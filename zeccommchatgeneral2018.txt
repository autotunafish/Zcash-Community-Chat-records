How do you mean @bran ? The default tx fee for Zcash is 0.0001 ZEC. Jaxx may set that number differently though.

hi there I'm running the official zcash client for debian and using `zcashd --daemon`I don't understand why it is using only 50% of my cpu
also do you think it still makes sense to mine zcash in "solo" mode ?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:38 PM
Hi @t2792237 the Zcash client does have a very basic CPU miner, but if you want to have a chance to earn any Zcash you will be much better using your GPU
The odds of finding a block solo are very very very small, you will want to join a pool to have a return for your work
bran 1:46 PM
i mean, for example, this txn: https://explorer.zcha.in/transactions/473fcbb46b1adbd8852ba7d6e3f23411fd304228022c8f744c575bc621935280 here my sended amount is 0.11, what is 0.004?

mineZcash Admin Owner 2:08 PM
Is that a change address in your wallet? Or a tx fee charged by Jaxx? You can see the basic tx fee was 0.0001
Did the 0.004 disappear from your balance or is it still in your wallet?

mineZcash Admin Owner 4:51 PM
@tromer a first step would be to make the basic Zcash miner able to use your GPU
There is also somewhat of a systemic risk that arises from the fact that the only software that is being used for Mining is closed sourced from anonymous developers

But I'm not sure that would necessarily reduce the pool centralization issue

You see I‚Äôm fairly new to the block chain Trend and I‚Äôve been doing lots of research and I just wondered if I could find some helpful info here due to the fact that blockchain (a wonderful breakthrough in cryptography) has been flooded on the internet with scams! I am trying to make sense of a loophole I mady have found and need some more reliable info to hopefully either explore and exploit it or fix it. Because I don‚Äôt believe all these ‚Äòget rich quick ads‚Äô but there is value in this breakthrough and if I can help fix a problem I would love to! So if someone can tell me which hashing algorithm Zcash uses that would be great! Thanks again
bran 10:33 PM
@mineZcash, that's weird but no, I see some unknown output in my transaction, but no any extra fees charged. So, I read papers about protocol and guess, the unknown amount in that txn is part of some shielded transaction...

hi
krunch3r 11:29 PM
@tromer increase modularization / make interfaces to the zcash solver so that it is easy to drop in a custom made solver and easy to identify the inputs and outputs -- along with this, documentation and examples. ideally, this would facilitate solo-mining (never say impossible) or enable more people to create pools. a significant indirect effect of this would be people would be more interested in running their own nodes and having more nodes means a faster more robust more reliable network along with all the benefits of decentralization of mining power. alternatively, the difficulty could be lowered to empower solo miners (again encouraging more nodes to run). there was some buzz about proof of stake but if miners have all the stake the issues concerning concentration/monopolization is not addressed...
is = are

i mean PoW is great and all and difficulty should not be too low but should be calculated not only based on the summation of hash power but the distribution.
anyhoo, guys, zcash-wizards channel is dead this holiday. can anyone here help me with PoW and the equihash generator ?

Hi all,
Forgive my ignorance, I'm not familiar with Zcash.
I have a friend who was using the zcash4mac wallet some time ago to receive payments from genesis mining. At some point, he uninstalled his wallet before he received his first payout. He re downloaded it today and his T-address is the same as his payout address on genesis, but his wallet balance shows as 0. Shouldn't it have the balance if the addresses match?
Could someone please assist/clarify this with me so I can let him know?

zcash wallet has me pretty confused, if someone could enlighten me it would be appreciated.

Started with a wallet that as an example say had the following:

tAddress_A: 0.05

Then performed a successful transaction using zcash-cli z_sendmany from tAddress_A to a friend's address tAddress_F, which had a fee of 0.001. So far so good.

zcash-cli z_gettotalbalance reports 0.0299. Once again, still good.

However, when I examine the balance for zcash-cli z_getbalance tAddress_A: 0.02? which is not what I would expect?

Digging around via zcash-cli listunspent, I now see that there is a new tAddress_B, which has 0.0099 in it? However, this address only shows up in the zcash-cli listunspent command and zcash-cli listaddressgroupings. Why did this new taddress get created?
additionally, can I transfer funds from tAddress_B to tAddress_A to consolidate funds without inuring fees?

Hi @maciej you are observing the behaviour of change addresses. Once funds have been spent the change is returned to another address in your keypool. It's this way in Bitcoin and many other currencies.
https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change

    en.bitcoin.it
    Change - Bitcoin Wiki

There is no reason to transfer funds from address A to address B if both addresses are in the same wallet. The next time you send zcash-cli will withdraw funds from any addresses that are in your wallet (keypool) to fill the transaction.
maciej 2:53 PM
Thank you for the explanation and link. This then leads me to another question though. Since this new tAddress_B, is a new address, that my wallet did not contain before, should I backup my wallet after each transaction? As it may now contain new tAddresses?
such that I can restore it on another system if needed?
maciej 2:59 PM
or are all possible taddresses of the keypool already part of the wallet?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:16 PM
When you perform a backup it saves all the addresses in your _transparent_ keypool at that time. If you generate new _private_ z-addresses for receiving funds you need to backup each time since there is no Private keypool @maciej

ok all, when I use z_sendmany and check on the status it fails indicating I do not have enough coins. my t addresses combined are enough. what gives?

*bump* why can't I spend from my combined t balance of coins?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:32 PM
@krunch3r if you specified an address then you need to be sure that _that_ address has the funds to fulfill the amount
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:39 PM
Otherwise you can use `sendmany` to send from all _transparent_ addresses in the wallet, and add the tx fee per kb (this is the old Bitcoin RPC method)
krunch3r 12:12 AM
hi all, i have funds spread out across t_addresses but when I send from my z address it always fails with insufficient funds. why's this? (i have a combined balance to cover).
krunch3r 12:53 AM
apparently I need to use zcash-cli sendmany to draw from the pooled balance.
so I guess I answered my own question.
ls
perhaps this should be in the api doc for those new to the bitcoin api
err, not sendmany zcash-cli sendtoaddress
although sendmany would work if I specified multiple amounts

it does look like it's in the blockchain so it should have "gone through", so whoever is supposed to receive the transaction might have a buggy node or some other problem

jasondavies 11:02 AM
@Elodin that kind of depends on how large your mining farm is, but typically you don't need much bandwidth since the amount of data sent is quite small, and most mining pools will automatically adjust difficulty to reduce bandwidth usage (this is called "vardiff" or variable difficulty).
I should think 4 Mbps is perfectly fine for typical miners.

good question, i'm no expert at mining but you can start mining and see whether you are getting "shares"....
i'm running two miners right now and checking my bandwidth consumption.... current in 1.37 kBit/s outgoing: 1.61 kBit/s so you're good on download and upload
adding my full node, max incoming: 1 MBit/s max max outing: 3.65 MBit/s ... that's with my full node running but average is actually much less, less than 1 mBit/s either down or up so you can even run a full node and throttle if concerned. use nload on linux as one option to see network bandwidth data.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:36 AM
@mineZcash looks like this was missed: for every block, the net flow into or out of the Sprout circuit is cached in the block index (by summing up `vpub_old - vpub_new` for every JoinSplit in the block), and the circuit total is the sum of all net flows starting from the genesis block.
mineZcash January 5, 2018 4:08 AM
@ebfull So does it show the _actual_ number in circulation, or is it a calculation based on time/blocks/distribution? Would it show _if_ there were extra coins floating around somewhere?
Rjay 10:11 AM

mineZcash Admin Owner 10:25 AM
So is that effectively a total supply audit @str4d ?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:28 AM
If someone also counted up the transparent funds, then yes. What this is doing is tracking whether the amount of funds exiting ever exceeds the amount going in, which would cause the Sprout circuit value to be negative
(Currently nothing happens in that case, but there's discussion of possibly having nodes shut down if they detect such a condition)
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:30 AM
So that addresses the criticism of the lack of a method to audit Zcashs total supply. I'm surprised this hasn't been the subject of a Blog post. It seems very useful

Hi @shubox transactions are sent/received to the Blockchain. Once you're Node is fully synced up it will send the transaction.

As some of you may know, OpenBazaar has built a new version that supports Zcash.

Under the wallet options, user can choose between Economic, Normal and Priority fee.

I asked in the OpenBazaar Slack what are the exact fees per each selection and Chris Pacia replied "It uses the zcash binary for fee estimation. I don't know what algorithm they use. It targets 1 block, 3 blocks and 6 blocks."

So what are those fees in the end?

mineZcash Admin Owner 3:48 PM
@dimitris.apostolou the default tx fee is 0.0001 ZEC so I would assume that OpenBazzar would be the same. However if they are just using the Bitcoin inherited `sendmany` as opposed to `z_sendmany` then the tx fee is calculated per KB, just like Bitcoin

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 3:50 PM
I think Chris was referring to something else.
"It targets 1 block, 3 blocks and 6 blocks."

This is the key.
So it appears there is a way to programmatically force the tx to confirm in 1, 3, 6 blocks etc.
If that is true, what are the exact fees per case?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:58 PM
If they are using the Bitcoin inherited fee structure then you may be able to use a cli call to calculate it https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/10199
Maybe `estimaterawfee` would work?

noob question: can one access your zcash using your z-address? I've been told 't' and 'z' addresses are like public and private addresses, respectively. But that doesn't really seem to be a good analogy
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 11:21 PM
@ligo t-addresses are like Bitcoin. They are public and everyone can see them. z-addresses are completely private.

Go to http://zcashnetwork.info and enter any t-address. You can see the transactions and amounts. Now try entering any z-address. "No matching records found!"

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:40 AM
@yigit The problem is most likely the Exodus Eden wallet. There is a bug in their wallet where it cannot sync the Zcash blockchain. This bug has been reported to them multiple times on Reddit. You should contact their support to fix it.
@stanislav The transaction is confirmed as you can see in the block explorer http://zcashnetwork.info/tx/df649c26b456acb6ab475635b3552c64e9207eff3707f978375758c7738d96aa

@dimitris.apostolou Eden is an unsupported version of Exodus.I tried to contact them but they have no support for eden wallet.So if something wrong happens, you're on your own. Exodus Customer Support can not help you. In this case I really don't know what to do and lost in it.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:33 AM
@yigit Don't worry. Your funds are safe as they are not stored within Eden. This is just a wallet that connects to the blockchain. You can export your private keys and import them to any other wallet that supports Zcash.

all I did import private keys on desktop and than export them to zcas4mac
@dimitris.apostolou
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:10 AM
@yigit ok, you exported them from Eden but then you need to import them to zcash4mac. When you exported them from Eden, you probably got a text file that includes the addresses and private keys. You need to open that text file, copy each private key and import it in zcash4mac under "Wallet -> Import one private key" menu. Then you need to wait for a blockchain rescan that takes at least 30mins for each key. Is that what you did?

Hello guys, on last friday i have transfered 2,5 ZEC from Coinroom to Exodus Eden and till now they haven't come to my Exodus Wallet... If somebody could help me to found it?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 8:07 AM
@etrust There is a known bug in Exodus Eden, where it cannot sync the blockchain because, allegedly, it has been banned from using a specific 3rd party Zcash server. So unless Exodus fixes this bug, the funds will not appear there.

But in any case, your funds are safe. Exodus is just an interface to the blockchain. No funds are saved within the app. So you could just export your private keys from Exodus, import them on the full node wallet and start using them.

If you scroll a bit further up, you can find instructions on how to do that. I posted them on Jan 21.

Hello, new miner here and enjoying things so far learning curve is not too steep. I have a question for others using Claymore miner. Is it normal for there to be pulse in share production and to have you volume decrease? I am not referring to the dev fees, don't have an issue there. Just over an 8 hour time period it goes up and down almost like a sine wave and wondering if this is normal or i should be trying to find out what is causing it.

Depends on what you're basing those values on
On average I find between 0.14 and 0.19, the payout timeframes vary back and forth by an hour or so over the week, across a month thats a potential difference of about 0.2

So Poloniex has USD 15 which they have not credited you? Still worth emailing them every week with the txids detailing the balance that has not been credited yet..

Quick test to find out the current transaction speed when sending from Monero to Monero using monerod0.10.3.1-1459-gecd0f5d.

Used slow transaction priority (x0.25 fee)

Sending: 10sec
Transaction appeared as confirmed: 5min04sec
Total time: 5min14sec
Results:

Zcash z address total transaction time: 9m25sec
Zcash z address transaction fee: 0.0001 ZEC (0.0037 EUR)
Monero total transaction time: 5min14sec
Monero transaction fee: 0.002984660000 XMR (0.7987 EUR)

Conclusion:

Monero transaction speed (even on the slowest priority) is much faster than current Sprout z address transaction.
Zcash transaction fee is much lower than Monero.

bitcartel 3:06 PM
A lot depends on the miners at the time. You might have been unlucky at the time of sending the transaction i.e. no new blocks arrived for 9m. Or perhaps there were new blocks but your transaction faced fee competition to get in (were there any near 2MB blocks at the time?).

JSON means that something as small as a space or comma could be incorrect. My syntax may be wrong, I'm not at my node to check I didn't think you needed the extra quotes. Would you know @str4d @daira @NealJayu ?
When you put in the amount to send do you have the zero in front of the decimal? Could you post your exact command line @jcc

jcc 1:37 PM
fwiw I'm getting the error when trying to send regular transactions as well
bitcartel 1:57 PM
Quick answer is to take a UTF-8 string and convert to hex and then use this hex string as part of the RPC call.
Neal on the back end can use z_listreceivedbyaddress to see the hex striing of the memo and then decode that to a UTF-8 string.
Also there is a new RPC method z_listunspent which might make it into 1.0.15 subject to code review, which will also display the memo field.
Maybe there is some XML/ISO format which is standard to use for ecommerce, so one could use that, but its probably fine for this first iteration to just have a string with the customers name and address in the memo field, where they want the stickers to be mailed.
For example "bitcartel, 1 infinte loop, usa" would be "62697463617274656c2c203120696e66696e7465206c6f6f702c20757361" in hex and you would use that as the memo field parameter in the call.
I used https://codebeautify.org/string-hex-converter but there are many converters out there.

@Codov Just to be sure. As I understand, this is the first transaction you are ever doing on your full node, correct? Are you certain that the receiving address is part of your zcash4win wallet? Check under the "Own addresses" tab. Do you see the address there?

hi guys, sorry for the simple question but do I use z_sendmany to go from a shielded address to a transparent one?
or is it just "sendmany"?
yeopp 7:32 PM
alright, got it. you need z_sendmany because you need to de-sheild
jcc 8:59 PM
Ok! Got it to work. Here is my exact format: `zcash-cli z_sendmany "zcFROM" '[{"address": "zcTO" ,"amount": 0.01 ,"memo":"43686173HEX"}]'`

The issue I was having seems to deal with the commas between address, amount, and memo. Before the comma was placed right after the closing quotes, but the help text had a space between the closing quote with comma next to subsequent open quote. When I changed it to read as the help text, it worked and my jaw dropped :)

My initial formatting was from the User Guide (which was also @mineZcash's, and was not working at all: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide#sending-coins-with-your-z-addr
I wonder if I change the commas there if it would work as well?

The auto-deprectiation block height has now passed, so if you are on 1.0.12 it will refuse to start
To bypass the depreciation (if you don't want to upgrade) then you need to stop your node, add `disabledepreciation=1.0.12` to the configuration file, then re-start.

@PwnZillia Did you stop zcashd before editing the config file? I'm thinking that if zcashd was already running, it would not listen to the config file. Did you try restarting your machine, edit the config file and then start zcash4win?

Also, I assume zcash4win used to work for you until yesterday and just stopped working now. If this is the first time you run zcash4win, you might be hitting a separate issue (probably related to antivirus software blocking zcashd).

@mineZcash Sorry to drag up an old message but I can't get my head around this and I think I am missing something. Surely this feature tracks coins movement in and out of the Sprout circuit. Is it not feasible that if someone could create false proofs then so long as the coins are not leaving the circuit they wouldn't be detected? Isn't the only real way to audit the coins to force them to move between circuits such as from Sprout to Sapling and only then could we be convinced no new coins were forged? This total value tracking tool tool seems very useful but it seems to fall short of fully auditing the money supply?
mineZcash January 17, 2018 5:26 PM
As far a total number of Zcash out there, feel free to read through this post I put in Reddit a few days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/7pejlr/comment/dshhhs9
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:46 PM
I think that is a valid point, but I don't think there is a plausible way to force all coins to become unshielded then reshielded for such an audit without compromising privacy. I'm not an expert, perhaps @ebfull would have a better answer for you. Also what would the attacker have to gain by only adding to the circuit but never removing coins to spend? That would be equivalent me sitting at home printing counterfeit $100 bills but never spending them. Lots of effort for no gain.
ebfull Electric Coin Company 3:49 PM
if you receive a shielded payment to your z-addr from someone else's z-addr then there is no accountability of the amounts for you to reason about (unless you received more in the payment than what is shielded!)
in the same way there's very limited accountability for seeing how many coins enter or exit the sprout circuit. just because more coins are shielded than are exiting the sprout circuit doesn't mean the coins exiting the sprout circuit weren't counterfeited
it does mean that we can be sure if counterfeiting took place under some situations (more leaves sprout than goes in)
you could theoretically counterfeit but do nothing with the coins and never take it out of the circuit, but that isn't the goal of a counterfeiter. counterfeiters spend/deposit/circulate their false money
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:53 PM
So the circuit audit is a partial solution but only would show when the attacker started moving the forged funds.
ebfull Electric Coin Company 3:54 PM
more or less. it's actually a full solution IMO because it prevents runaway inflation. if we find a bug and need to move everyone to a new system for some reason, we won't have to worry that a zillion phantom zec will continue to exist
(at least for some definition of "full")
as zooko likes to point out, this is the tradeoff you accept when you introduce cryptographic assumptions to protect privacy
for example i can never see bitcoin adding support for some ECC-based privacy system without compartmentalizing and auditing it in this way
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:56 PM
Good points
Do I recall correctly that @str4d had proposed some sort of "turnstile" audit to count coins when switching circuits at some point? Would that be something that could be done when transparent addresses are depreciated?
Similar to what @gareth is suggesting?
ebfull Electric Coin Company 4:18 PM
it's a proposal that's been around for a long time
but yeah
it implicitly occurs when we deprecate sprout/t-addrs someday
some others like zooko want it to happen more routinely
no plan for that yet though

Thanks for that üëç Interesting reading üòÉ I guess I am thinking when shielded transactions become more prominent it would be possible for a counterfeiter to spend and circulate their false money more easily (assuming they did it at a low enough rate to not be detected). Obviously in the current environment this is a very practical approach to detecting it. I agree with the fact there will be tradeoffs it's more my confusion was over how this circuit audit is sometimes presented (which doesn't actually prove no new coins have been created).

@NealJayu Couldn't be easier than using the GUI wallet though üôÇ
NealJayu 1:18 PM
I agree that a multi-platform GUI wallet capable of sending shielded transactions is important for the ecosystem and now that the three main ones are experiencing trouble, we're seeing how much everyone relied on third party wallets with a single maintainer.

- Zcash4Win - Didn't implement disabledeprecate flag, now erroring out.
- Zcash4Mac - 'Currently deprecated'
- Swing Wallet for Linux - 'DEPRECATED: not to be used!'

The swing wallet (which is the one I use) actually works fine. Vaklinov deprecated it because guys like me kept filing bug reports and he's too busy to deal with them so prefers to deprecate it than offer support.
NealJayu 1:20 PM
Good to know, but that also means I can't recommend it to anyone because of all the warnings. 'Don't worry, it's fine.'

I'm glad to hear that the Zcash Foundation will be working on an independent implementation of the core wallet software. I would very much advocate for a Qt GUI wallet maintained by Zcash Co or the Zcash Foundation.

I urge for a Swift GUI walllet üôÇ
Qt has too many inherent memory leaks. zcashd already has tons of them. No need for more on the UI side üôÇ
Our Monero friends decided to utilize Qt for their GUI. And I ran a memory leak check on their GUI.

Vaklinov withdrew his Grant submission after it had been awarded, but before payment. Lack of time seems to be the main reason it was withdrawn.
I have to say the current status of many of the community run projects is not good. The Zcash4win and Zcash4mac wallets need constant tending due to depreciation deadlines,
Vaklinov has depreciated the GUI because of constantly getting questions, mostly by users who don't understand that it's just a interface for a full node, not a lite wallet.
And Lusto is in the process of trying to find someone who can maintain zchain, again due to lack of time and resources. He may simply close it and re-direct the URL to Radix42s insight block explorer.
I have seen that more engineers are being hired by Zcash Co in the weekly development updates, are there any plans to support these resources @zooko ?

@mineZcash Not in the short-term, no. Our first priority is to deliver Overwinter and Sapling on time, and with a high level of security and stability. The new team members that we're hiring are going to start on the second priority, which is onboarding partners like exchanges, and hosted wallets, and third-party projects like OpenBazaar, and fixing performance bugs in in the linux command-line clients, and doing more security monitoring and incident response planning and security auditing and hardening, and reviewing our operational security within the Zcash Company, and more things along those lines.
mineZcash February 4, 2018 1:51 PM
I have seen that more engineers are being hired by Zcash Co in the weekly development updates, are there any plans to support these resources @zooko ?
Also, it kind of makes me sad to imagine a future in which things migrate from being community-maintained or maintained by independent other companies to being maintained by the Zcash Company. It would seem to be going in the wrong direction and unsustainable.
(Unless we changed the consensus rules to give The Zcash Company perpetual funding from the blockchain for such tasks.)
Now, that said, I'm totally open to the possibility of the Zcash Company making a GUI wallet! I'd love that. But we're not going to de-prioritise either of the above two things (Sapling and core-maintenance-and-security) in order to do it right away, which means that we won't be able to get started on it just yet.

Goodmorning/afternoon to all! I have another question..
In the event I needed to reinstall zcash4win, I'm assuming I need to backup some sort of private key or something to be able to "pull" that same wallet when reinstalling, correct? If so, any insight on this?
PwnZillia 10:02 AM
I'm also confused when people refer to the SWING UI wallet and zcash4win... almost sounds like the same thing but look like they come from two different developers.
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:16 AM
@PwnZillia Zcash4win includes Vaklinov's swing UI so it basically the same thing. From my understanding you just need to uninstall Zcash4win and re-insall the new version when it comes out. That is based on the feedback from users in this thread: https://forum.z.cash/t/urgent-zcash4win-update/24435/10

    forum.z.cash
    URGENT zcash4win update
    Is installing the new version really as easy as uninstalling the old program and then installing the new one? Do I have to do anything special with my private key or my wallet.dat file?

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:03 PM
@PwnZillia But, just in case, always have a backup of your wallet.dat file, and I would highly recommend to export your private key(s) via Wallet -> Export private keys. It's better to be safe than sorry.
john.bruhling 4:15 PM
Yes backup regularly!

PwnZillia 9:39 PM
@dimitris.apostolou I will definitely be backing up my private keys, thanks for the how-to. @mineZcash I think I need to backup my private key first before I install to the latest version, how would the new wallet be able to know its me still? I would think you would need both the wallet.dat file and private keys. That thread you linked me in just told me about adding the deprecation line to my configuration file which I already did.
I think what I'm most confused about, is if this version 1.0.12 is deprecated... is there a version for us to download that is NOT deprecated that I'm missing? @NealJayu Thanks for the link, good to know.. Not sure why you tagged me in that exactly though?

Is possible to buy a Zcash coin from Ecuador? How? I have credit card, paypal VISA and i can bank transfer too. I hope you can tell me. üôÇ
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:29 AM
@PwnZillia The wallet.dat file includes the private keys. So having just that is fine. But it's always safer to have the private keys separately, just in case. This way, if you lose your wallet.dat, you can create a new empty wallet, import your private keys and you are back to where you were. Having your private keys separate offers another advantage. You can import them to any other 3rd party wallet and access your funds there.

Regarding zcash4win, @radix42 is preparing a new version.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:46 AM
@billions.ec2018 Buying Zcash directly with credit card is possible but options are pretty limited at this time. You can definitely do it in cex.io but they are not accepting new registrations anymore so if you're not already registered, you're out of luck for now. With bank transfer you have many options. The most direct option is from Kraken. You deposit fiat, exchange for Zcash, then withdraw to your wallet. If Kraken does not work for you for any reason, you could go to Coinbase, deposit fiat, exchange for Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin (they have very low fees), transfer that to GDAX (free transfer), exchange it to Zcash and withdraw to your wallet. You will lose a bit in exchange fees with this process though. Another option is, assuming you already have Bitcoin or some other crypto, to use a fast exchange like Changer or Evercoin. Let me know if you have trouble with any of these options. I can provide plenty more.

How do you claim zcash from the bitcoin fork that created zcash? If that's possible.
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:32 PM
@fractalzen Zclassic and other forks made their own Genesis block so they are completely separate from Zcash chain.
There is nothing to claim.
fractalzen 2:35 PM

mineZcash Admin Owner 2:36 PM
@Pataf I don't think Zcash is ARM compatible due to some dependencies. And some are only 32 bit, without enough RAM. I guess it would depend on the processor/board
fractalzen 2:51 PM
@mineZcash Just to clarify. I was talking about the bitcoin fork that happened on October 28, 2016 to create zcash in the first place. I was wondering if I would have zcash coming in the amount of bitcoin I held back then.
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:57 PM
Same story, Zcash used the Bitcoin code based to build upon and created the first Genesis block on Oct 28th. It's not a fork of Bitcoin. To do that would have put millions of Zcash into circulation on day 1, which is not what the developers wanted. They even implemented a "slow start" so that miners would have time to get up to speed.
fractalzen 3:03 PM
Okay, good to know. Thanks.

Anyways, if any of the Zcash devs read this and are interested, I'll stick around in your slack channel for a bit, please feel free to PM me if interested. Thanks Guys!

It's appreciated. Yea, I think we all will do very well in crypto in the end game and it's still very young... No reason for projects to be adversarial. There's much more that can be accomplished working symbiotically. Atleast that's what we're shooting for.

Side note, uninstall, delete roaming, fresh install of zcash4win seems to work, then close, apply patch, open and import keys

Yea, super stoked to see what the future brings with all the crackdown's happening... feels like we're living in the prohibition years 2.0 globally right now... Privacy coins are gonna make a lot of people very rich as time goes on. Exciting times. Thanks for the info btw, will pass it along and see if it works with the bitcoinZ client as well

@zagrr I'd look at the built in CPU miner code in zcashd https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/pow/tromp/equi.h . nicehash also has some MIT-licensed GPU code (CUDA I think) in https://github.com/nicehash/nheqminer .

A question from the discord server.. is ZCash like Bitcoin with respect to gathering a bunch of smaller UTXO for an input to pay a single output in being that the transaction is more costly due to the size of the tx?
tromer Zcash Foundation 12:33 PM
@acmeloon Zcash transaction fees are always at 0.0001 ZEC per transaction, regardless of size (unless you manually override).
Though if you had many hundreds of input UTXOs, you may run into transaction size limits and will need to issue multiple transactions, each with a 0.0001 ZEC fee.

I think motherboard have a Max number of pci cards that can be added.
Could be that. Could be your riser. Could be that the PSU simply cannot put out enough power.
Maybe a bad card.
First things first, swap that card with another that is known to be working. If it works, then at least you have ruled out a bad riser.

helping a friend get set up to accept zcash at his farm/farmer's market and have a basic question
with the light clients and mobile wallets, you of course can't send private transactions
but can you receive private transactions from any type of wallet?
ice.1 6:11 AM
Has joined the channel.
@jrmoreau I believe you have to have a z_address to receive the private transactions and stay private. But wallets that support private transactions can send from Z to the T address of a lite wallet.
Basically if you're running a lite wallet you can create a T address and pretty much all other types of wallets can send to that T address, it just won't be private.

For those running insight-based blockchain explorers, are you running off of https://github.com/str4d/zcash/tree/v1.0.13-bitcore ? @str4d if you're around, is there anything tricky you have to do to maintain that patch wrt upgrading to 1.0.14? Gonna try that in a bit, hopefully it's straightforward

    github.com
    str4d/zcash
    zcash

er, or maybe I should just wait for 1.0.15 to land
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:19 PM
I can update it after 1.0.15 lands
But no, nothing hard if you want to try it for 1.0.14

```
git checkout v1.0.14
git checkout -b v1.0.14-bitcore
git cherry-pick v1.0.13..v1.0.13-bitcore
```

I can't think of anything we've landed since then that might cause problems, but basically just deal with merge conflicts as they come up.
When I originally made that patchset, I had to backport a bunch of it because the upstream Bitcore patchset was written for 0.12, whereas we are based on 0.11.2
But since then we've pulled in upstream PRs that mean I've had to un-backport bits of it üòÖ
Eventually I'd like to migrate to their 0.13 patchset, which is much cleaner, but requires more upstream PRs.

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:03 AM
I'm not super familiar with Dashs privacy feature, but from what I understand it's a mixer for a few participants, not really comparable to zkSNARKS
And Bitcoin Private is based on Zclassic, which is a fork of Zcash.
I wouldn't say that Bitcoin Private has any big advantage over Zcash since they have already said they will be pulling from Zcashs work
You can fork Zcash, but you simply can't duplicate the Development Team that Zcash has.

@matthewufa The only thing you can do is complain to Cryptonator support. Since the transaction is confirmed in the block explorer, it means the only one at fault here is Cryptonator.
@matthewufa Also, I would highly advice to download a full node and secure your funds or get a hardware wallet.

Hi, I'm having trouble using z_importwallet (and yes, I'm trying to import a file created by z_exportwallet).
documentation says that z_importwallet looks in the zcashd working directory... however I've tried placing the exported file within the same directory as zcashd (src) and also within the datadir (~/.zcash) and neither work
from terminal, in ~/zcash/src I type:
./zcash-cli z_importwallet "TESTDUMP"
(TESTDUMP being the wallet exported via z_exportwallet "TESTDUMP")
The error I receive is:
error code: -8
error message:
Cannot open wallet dump file
Any ideas on why this is happening / if there are syntax issues?
It's a pretty important issue üòï
Also, I should mention, I'm using a freshly generated wallet.dat in .zcash
a1x 9:31 PM
I'll be back in the morning. Hopefully someone can help.
konstantinsolov 10:09 PM
Hey, guys. is it possible to technically create a twin wallet Zec while the other one is frozen on the stock exchange or the number is unique?
Can the transaction come to the replica of the wallet? Is such a vulnerability possible?
bitcartel 10:12 PM
Do you have the private key for your zcash address at the exchange?
konstantinsolov 10:54 PM
@bitcartel where is the private key available on the stock exchange? the situation is this-I made a transfer to the stock exchange while the wallet was frozen because of Pump. the funds for the wallet never came,but they are already there by blockchain.Could they at this time come to someone's replica purse?
konstantinsolov 11:06 PM
if you help me, I'd appreciate it. I am new to cryptomeria and some things do not know.only heard about some of the vulnerabilities Meltdown,Spectre.and then once faced with error transfer.
bitcartel 11:10 PM
So it sounds like you sent funds from your local wallet to an address A at exchange. If you enter address A into a blockchain explorer e.g. zcash.blockexplorer.com, can you see the funds? Now, if the exchange has frozen wallets, you'll have to contact them and find out when they will resume normal service.
konstantinsolov 11:24 PM
This situation occurred with the exchange Poloniex and two days later the wallet was already active only funds on it was not.A ticket to tech support but have created more than 40 days no response. Sent to another exchange and zcash.blockexplorer.com status for more 23719 CONFIRMATIONS.Wallet poloniex with no transactions.

hey fine folks of Zcash! I had a couple questions for y'all üôÇ... 1) what is your take on a potential government crackdown on privacy coins, such as Zcash, through regulation, ultimately leading to certain exchanges having to delist as a result? and 2) I can imagine this is a somewhat sensitive topic, but with Zclassic being a fork of Zcash and now forking to Bitcoin Private, what do you see as Zcash's main competitive advantage?
[OFTC/yolart] @rocket.cat Bot 4:43 PM
hi
dc Electric Coin Company 4:56 PM
Has joined the channel.
@ashylarry lots going on on the Hill lately re: cryptocurrency, and under this administration I think a 'crackdown' on privacy coins is unlikely. Far more likely to see a crackdown on securities ICO's masquerading as token sales.
re your second question, I'd be hard pressed to back a clone when the original has the support of all the scientists that created the underlying technical innovation.
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:02 PM
@ashylarry I would say that having the Development Team that is inventing the protocol is a key advantage over Zclassic. If you read the Bitcoin Private roadmap, they are very enthusiastic about the future of privacy coins and they admit that they are relying on the Zcash Developers for advancements in cryptography. As I have mentioned before: forking code is easy, inventing the cryptography is hard.
And I have yet to see any real "crack-down" being proposed by a government entity. There have been proposals that would make hiding the fact that you have crypto currency holdings illegal but Zcash is perfectly capable of complying with any such regulations through tools such as Selective Disclosure and view keys.

[OFTC/yolart] @rocket.cat Bot 5:12 PM

mineZcash Admin Owner 5:16 PM
I agree with @dc the SEC and CFTC have stated that the focus should be on protecting the investor from fraud. Unfortunately some of the ICOs lately have been big on hype but thin on actual product and ability to deliver on promises. This makes it hard for a new comer to the crypto currency space to tell what is a legitimate offering and what is not.

turri 4:00 PM
yes

You should (and please anyone else correct me if I am wrong) just be about to directly import the private keys of ZCL into ZEC. They are the same protocol, so the private/public key pairing should be the same

Download the ZCL private key, and import it to the ZEC wallet

@choberts that would be amazing if that would work!!! I M gonna give it a shot, thanks for your suggestion I ll let you know if that works
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:09 PM
I don't think you can import the keys from one Zclassic address to Zcash, they are completely separate blockchains
If you have sent the coins to an address on the Zclassic chain from Zcash then your funds are likely lost. Correct me if I'm wrong @str4d ?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:14 PM
No, it should work, assuming ZCL didn't change that part (and they didn't change many things they needed to, so I doubt they did)

If they aren't, and the thing that did the sending didn't validate the addresses, then you might have problems

If it looks different, then you're out of luck
turri 4:53 PM
yesh looks different
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:57 PM
Hmm, I just checked the ZCL source, and the address prefixes are unchanged. So a ZCL address should exactly map to a ZEC address
@turri `zcash-cli z_getbalance ZCL_ADDRESS 0`
That should fail if the ZCL address is not detected as being in the wallet (i.e. the imported private key is not usable for that address in ZEC)
If it succeeds, then you just need to wait for your node to sync
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:03 PM
If you are going to use several Zcashd based currencies, I would strongly suggest that you consider moving the Zclassic wallet and Zcash wallets (and perhaps the Bitcoin Private?) to separate machines/VMs. I have heard of some big issues between them: https://www.reddit.com/r/ZClassic/comments/7mhw25/having_all_sorts_of_trouble_running_the_zclassic/

thank you, giving this a try
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:44 AM
Yes, the blockchain requires 13.41GB of disk space.
keyian 9:44 AM
Oh wow ok. I would like to download it to my D drive, but it never gives me that option
it goes to my C by default
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:46 AM
On Mac and Linux you can create a symbolic link to "trick" it. It works fine that way. I'm sure you can do something similar on Windows.
keyian 9:47 AM
Can I do that if its already installed or would i have to reinstall?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:48 AM
You can do it whenever. You just need to move the blockchain folder to another drive and create a link on the original drive that points to the new location.
keyian 9:48 AM
Ok I will do that now
is it the blocks or the chainstate folder?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:51 AM
You could move the whole parent zcash folder if you want to.
blocks is 12,46GB and chainstate is 910MB currently.
keyian 9:53 AM
Ill do that. Im moving my whole zcash folder along with the zcashparams folder
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:54 AM
Yes, you can create as many links as you like.
keyian 9:58 AM
Still wants to install the blockchain on my c drive as well as the wallet. The only thing going to my d drive now is the installation
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:59 AM
Sorry but I can't give you specific technical advice for Windows. I am a Mac user.
Perhaps it would be easier (at least until you figure out a way to make the symbolic links work) to free up some space on your main drive and let it sync there.

Am I able to open my zcash4win wallet on it? I have transparent address and private key
Agreed. Im on it now though and the theme is great
Also very easy to use
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:40 AM
I'm not a big Exodus user but if I recall correctly, you first need to enable the Zcash wallet, then go to Developer -> Assets -> Zcash -> Move Funds (WIF) and enter your private key.
Or you could just send the funds to the newly created address as a transaction.
But I guess the second is not an option for you since you cannot access the wallet.
keyian 9:42 AM
I see what you mean. Unfortunately it's different for windows. The problem i'm having is that I can't get my zcash4win to start, therefore I can't access my funds on it
Yep. I just need to figure out how to get my private key on exodus
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:43 AM
Developer -> Assets -> Zcash -> Move Funds (WIF) and enter your private key

It worked. Thank you so much man. Appreciate the help
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:49 AM
Glad to be of assistance. I hope zcash4win gets updated so you can use it. It's much more secure than Exodus. Plus, you can only utilize shielded z addresses in the full node.

john.bruhling 3:09 PM
@mineZcash not sure if he did, a translated excerpt - Edward Snowden was on an interview from Russia via Google Hangout. He posed the big problem in the regular Internet: all transactions, even if encrypted, leave fingerprints. If it is known that I regularly send money to a certain person, it is secondary, which is the reason for the payment. Observers from outside then know that there is a connection here. E-mails, chat logs, Facebook and Google can be used to construct networks of relationships that provide employees of the NSA or Google with enough information about the individual. According to Snowden, projects like Tor or ZCash can do a lot to protect their own privacy. Although Edward Snowden finds the concept behind ZCash very convincing, he still opposes a maximalism regarding the cryptocurrencies. Maximalism was portrayed by another speaker very aptly as the nationalism in the crypto-ecosystem. It is the focus of individual groups on a crypto currency - be it the focus on Bitcoin alone, be it the dream of flipping or something similar. This kind of maximalism contradicts the approach of decentralization. (I don't even know what to say to this)
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:21 PM
It states that he mentioned Zcash and Tor as good ways to preserve privacy. Not the first time he has said something like that about Zcash.

nathan Electric Coin Company 3:00 PM
I haven't watched that video. Want to share my perspective:
Right now, since blocks aren't full, there's no fee pressure really.
By _convention_ we always set fees for shielded transactions to 0.0001. One problem with fees in shielded transactions is that if they are different between transactions that reveals _something_ about the shielded transaction, so we want to keep them identical for now.
Later, when blocks are full, shielded transactions _might_ become more expensive than "similarly shaped" transparent transactions. For example if txn A sends a single UTXO to 1 recipient and a change output, and txn B sends a single shielded Note to 1 recipient and a change output note, then txn A will probably be much smaller, so it may need to pay less in fees.
We want to keep the encrypted memo field, which I think is incredibly valuable, and it takes up a lot of the space of shielded transfers. Eventually I'd like to deprecate transparent transactions. With that in mind, I'm going to propose a future protocol upgrade should introduce more block space that's _only_ for shielded transactions. Then they will not be in direct fee competition with transparent transactions.

@nathan The video starts at the relevant bit, so only a few seconds of viewing required. Not really an issue.
@mineZcash A lot of misinformation is simply due to people not having reviewed the topic themselves and relying instead on information from a third party.

I agree, it just takes a few minutes on Reddit to see how much misinformation is out there
@nathan You know, it would be awesome if you or @zooko were to do a show like that once in awhile. There are so many cool things coming up this year and not much media to get people interested. That Doug Polk seems like a decent podcast

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 11:50 AM
In my opinion, zcash4mac/zcash4win are not "good". They kind of work but they are nowhere near "good". Maybe I'm too used to "very good" Mac software that "just works" üôÇ The kind that Apple itself makes. Perhaps it's a lot to ask from independent/amateur devs that work on it during their free time.

why isn't zcash keeping the trading game above our bottom line for mining?
I understand they need volatility etc but lower than our cost??? why? oil commodoties n others do not do that
I'm a small miner just wondering why the math lets that occur, is there a reason?
how can they keep stable supply for market demand that way? is the math out of line with basic market reality?
I love zcash but I'm worried about the feasibility of such quick profit losses on operations barely making it?
how can they claim the value is really this low?
I'm new to it so trying to understand how that can be possible, never seen an oil commodity drop to lower than rigs cost to run
isn't there a bottom line put in for miner protection like in other markets so market gamers cant halt an entire industry? just curious
just forces the market players to play slightly higher is all
tdport 8:14 AM
imo the regulators is GOOD news for all of us. I would think more security = higher value not lower but the press didn't add that into their releases
profit protection is a great idea imo
tdport 8:25 AM
also Russia isn't ciminalizing bitcoin! they are just requiring exchange that will actually cause more transactions for miners to verify! not bad news imho!
if my thinking is wrong I'm open to learn, I'm very new to mining but not to business and maybe I'm asking on the wrong forum, I'm trying to learn from more experienced mining professionals

You might be interested to know that I'm specifically looking into how much effort the "base layer" of Windows support would be (windows CI for zcashd, not an end-user GUI or installer package).
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:38 PM
I'm a Mac user and thankfully @kozyilmaz ports zcashd for macOS and pulls from master so I'm always on the latest.
But lots of Windows folks would love to be able to be on the latest too.
The problem is that, in general, Windows users are not used to the command line. So even if there is separate zcashd executable, most Windows users wouldn't even know how to launch it.
After the recent zcash4win issues, we have been trying to help folks "fix" it and is pretty clear most of them don't know how to use the command line.
nathan Electric Coin Company 4:26 PM
I understand that. GUIs like zcash4win ship with zcashd. If upstream released Windows binaries, it would make it easier to release upgrades to GUIs on Windows.

matalic 5:42 PM
I am using the linux client - zcashd --daemon
are my old addresses just dead? I didn't backup the wallet. I assumed it would recover...
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:54 PM
Dont worry too much, your funds should still be safe may just need to reindex if it crashed. Restart the node with `-reindex` and let it fully sync up before you query `z_gettotalbalance`
You should also make a backup of your wallet.dat file somewhere safe in case you need to completely re-install from scratch.
Are you running version 1.0.15? If not that could be an issue too.
matalic 6:02 PM
ooooh let me try that!
what's the complete command for a reindex?
do I need to stop zcashd before reindexing?
stopped the node, going to index... thanks for the help thus far! Been in a panic!
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:18 PM
Yes stop the node, then you can start it with `zcashd -reindex` and it will take some time to completely re-download and verify the chain.
matalic 6:26 PM
can I run it with --daemon in the back?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:49 PM
If you want to `-daemon` means that it will run in the background and not show the metrics screen. I prefer to just run zcashd normally to see the status and open another terminal to run commands.
matalic 7:31 PM
thats a good idea - will the reindex also recover my missing taddressess? When I list taddresses before running the reindex, I didn't see my older ones
matalic 9:52 PM
Its re-indexing
Also, the core crashed when I tried to send money from a z-add to a t-add, is that common? Secondly, there seems to be a difference between mined zcash and transacted zcash (mined zcash with sendmany sometimes throws that coinbase UXO error), how can I make mined zcash into transacted zcash so I can continue to send it?

This would dramatically increase the number of shielded transactions post-sapling-fork, since investing is currently the number 1 use case
matalic 7:13 AM
So, my zcashd crashed. After restarting, my taddresses I made previously were no longer showing. My balance was zero. I stopped the client, and restarted it with -reindex and waited the day for it to finish. After finishing, my balances are still zero and my taddresses I made before are gone. What happened? Does this happen typically? Can I fix it?
also, do I use sendmany to send between a zaddress and a taddress? I need to make mined coins to transacted coins to get rid of the "Could not find any non-coinbase UTXOs to spend" error.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:09 AM
@johanssonlc it's one of the design goals for Sapling. The hardware wallets themselves won't necessarily be making proofs, but will be able to authorize proofs made on the computer (which means the computer is trusted for privacy, but you already view your transactions on the computer anyway)

I'm surprised you were not able to fix your node, do you have a backup of your wallet.dat file you can transfer to a new node?
I've never heard of people losing funds due to a Node crash, remember the funds are on the Blockchain not in your wallet so you can still recover your funds if you have the wallet.dat file.
Which contains the private keys
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:54 PM
And to your other question, yes it is advisable to make backups each time you make a new Private address. If you are only using the transparent addresses you can go awhile between backups (because the node has a keypool of 100 addresses), but whenever you generate a z_address it is unique and needs to be backed up after generation.

@matalic when you say "my taddresses I made previously were no longer showing" how are you viewing t-addresses?
matalic 7:33 PM
with the list taddress method on the core - command line
I have a wallet.dat file, but when I go to list my addresses (zcash-cli getaddressesbyaccount "") I cannot see any of the addresses I previously created, and my total balance is zero.
all of which happened after my client crashed - the addresses when I list are not the same as before. I have no idea what happened, or how to recover.
matalic 7:40 PM
Let me be more clear - I was making a bunch of taddresses and zaddresses and moving money around just fine. I went to throw money from a zaddress to a taddress and the core crashed. After restarting the core, using the getaddressesbyaccount command showed completely different addresses than what I was using before the crash, and my balance blanked at zero. I -reindex the client, waited a day for it to finish, and alas my addresses have not changed back to the ones I was using before, and my balance remains at zero. Any clarity would be very helpful. I have a wallet.dat file, but I didn't back-up the wallet.dat before or after the crash.

@matalic If you have not backed up the wallet before the crash is not a good sign. Have you written down the private keys of your addresses? If yes, you can easily recover everything. If not, you may be in trouble if you cannot retrieve the pre-crash wallet file. Also, the pre-crash wallet.dat should not have just disappeared. I assume it has been renamed to something similar and is still in your folder. If you still have it, it is probably possible to recover it. I hope someone could help you with that.

There is a wallet.dat file - how do I know if it's precrash or postrash? I didn't manually back anything up though. Should I try importing it? I am a little hesitant to do much of anything anymore.

@matalic if you still have the original wallet.dat then there are still steps you can take to try to recover your funds. Setup a fresh node and transfer the wallet to it after installing, there are even programs that can extract keys from a corrupted wallet
Try the first step, backup the wallet.dat to a USB then do a clean install of Zcashd

I have tried so many options for , ("1"), ("0.000001") this part sadly none of them worked
nathan Electric Coin Company 2:49 PM
It should look like this:
`z_sendmany "t1LnyE2Nt1gJ7QQ4vi1AHDRh392qh5jpk1C" "[{\"amount\": 0.0001, \"address\": \"t1MPcjiK61YP6qBJ6yk24eXiEqDk1h1gTxx\"}]" 1 0.000001`
The depth and fee are separate commandline arguments, and not part of the JSON string that is the second parameter with the destinations/amounts/memos.
lmk if that works.

Hello
Guys i have a question.
First:
It's Equishash mining, compatible with Bitcoins traditional mining hardware?
I have a few of S9's.
But S9's are made for Bitcoin's hashing algorithm.

If used on Scrypt, it's not efficient at all.
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:21 PM
@okabe No, Zcash uses Equihash Algorithm which is ASIC resistant. Bitcoin SHA256 equipment is not compatible.
GPUs are the best for Zcash, Nvidia has the best performance per watt.
okabe 2:22 PM
I see.
And is it possible to hard-fork and reset block-chain on BitCoins based CryptoCoins?
Is not there any kind on guide?

@thetrunk It is possible to spam the network, yes, but if that happens then miners will automatically prioritise fee-paying transaction above feeless transactions. Bitcoin has already exercised that functionality on their mainnet and it worked.

[OFTC/joe] @rocket.cat Bot 2:02 PM
Is that possible? (send all funds without having to compute fees and deduce it manually)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:49 PM
joe, we added the z_mergetoaddress RPC method in 1.0.15 which can be used for that
(if you want to e.g. merge all funds to a z-addr, you'd call it like `z_mergetoaddress ["*"] Z_ADDR`)
It's currently an experimental feature (while we get feedback from users who test it), so you need to enable it with a zcashd config option.
You should test it with a small amount first (e.g. pass in a single address, or use the limit parameters to only merge a few UTXOs or notes)

With a backup private key, you can put your wallet on most any device (essentially copying it), but you can't change the address to which it was sent, be sure your blockchain is fully synced, you can check the transaction on the Explorer to ensure it exists

You mentioned that services like OpenBazaar and Shapeshift "mostly only support transparent addresses and don't support the shielded addresses at all yet". This is not true. Shapeshift in particular has been supporting z-addresses since 2016.

I don't speak for zcash, but if you're referring to being erased or your transaction info more specifically from a blockchain, I don't think that's possible with Zcash, in fact it's one of the underlying principles of a blockchain, if your referring to something else i apologize.

I don‚Äôt think its safe for any exchanges to support Z addresses hence there is no way to verified where minted coins is coming from and how many are legitimate minted. Unless we create a way to burn t address coins to z address. Then we know for sure the coin are legitimately minted since it can be verified on the blockchain. I think the con side of shield transactions, the day the exploit is found and used to mint coins. It would take a hard fork to fix this. Thoughts?

I would think so, although the two cases I can think of including TLS CA certs and apt signing keys go elsewhere because they are essential for the system, so outside of `/usr`.

t0dd 10:59 AM
Well... the binaries I have tested for a week. They are yours. They tend to segfault occassionally. But with zcashd as a service should restart on it's own. We'll see.
@nathan I _have_ successfully built from scratch on Fedora in the past. But these are repackages of your supplied binaries. There is some oddness in how the source builds in a mock/rpmbuild environment that I am pulling my hair out over. So for now, the RPMs are not built from scratch, but are from binaries from z.cash. Some people will prefer that anyway. But I don't. It's "wrong". üòâ
I then add a pile of config stuff to enable zcashd as a service running as user zcashuser, etc.
And I add back the missing license file from your binary. Ahem. üòâ (should file a ticket)
@nathan Anyway... once I get everything rockin' and rollin' the way I like it... I will file a ticket.

Hi everyone! I can't use the Zcash testnet (overwinter 1.015). when i run zcashd, there isn't any downloading of block:
Downloading blocks | 0 / ~230240 (0%)

Network solution rate | 0 Sol/s

and in the debug.log i can see this:

dimitris.apostolou April 7, 2018 6:30 AM
Yes, you need to download the whole blockchain in order to see recent transactions.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:34 AM
Don't worry, you will see the funds when the blockchain is synced.
alexd88 6:38 AM
@dimitris.apostolou so my address generated once and nobody never can't generate same addrr again in the feature? How it was generated without blockchain, or it's unnecessary to downloading bc data?
dimitris.apostolou April 7, 2018 6:34 AM
Don't worry, you will see the funds when the blockchain is synced.

Yes, address is random. No blockchain required to generate address.

@alexd88 that is a good question, it may depend on just randomization and even though many transparent addresses have been generated across many chains (i guess they would be of no consequence) the total possible number of 32
Character case sensitive alphanumeric adressess begining with t would be 62^31 (A-Z,a-z,0-9), which is 3.6655772e+55, so the odds of random regeneration minus the number of existing addresses is 1 in 366557720000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 (i believe)
john.bruhling 2:56 PM
So it is possible and I would say if it happens, then fate is real (edit- this is also assuming that every character generated had nothing to do with any other character generated)

*shrug*, as a cryptographer you soon cease to be impressed by big numbers
the reason this particular comparison seems so imbalanced is just that you're comparing a number of configurations with the size of a configuration
if you were comparing the number of possible keys with the number of possible states of any natural thing, the latter would be *much* larger (if the states are distinguished finely enough)

@john.bruhling how do you know that only one actual path is taken? in a multiple-worlds scenario, the subjective experience of sentient beings in each world would not be very different from that in a single-world scenario, with the caveat that they might be able to observe the effects of "leakage" between worlds if the physics allows (which is plausibly what we might be seeing in quantum physics experiments)

note that there are interesting consequences for ethical reasoning if multiple possibilities do in fact happen (let's assume without loss of generality that such a scenario is compatible with free will)

john.bruhling 9:08 AM
I wasn't really referring to the multi Universal branching at the infinite instances of possibility, nor did I ever even think about them leaking into each other (thats kinda like that show sliders), I was referring to our own perception within this universe (I should have specified) and the idea of choice. For instance, you responded to my earlier post and effectively (though metaphorically) took another step along your path (yours because its all tied together but we deal with things on a personal level). Supposedly any number of different things could have ensued, and maybe they did somewhere assuming that which cannot be disproven must be invariably true. But here, only one choice from an infinite is realized, the single path. So it could be that very viewpoint of infinite choice possibility that perhaps binds more tightly us to a fate inescapability. Idk

The idea of freewill in a causality driven universe is probably a never ending conversation (even with ourselves). I like it but its hard to coalesce. Diara rocks by the way in case yall didn't know that

@daira, I summarized the main advantages of STARK over SNARK, as already pointed out in my video talks: more scalable prover (currently \~10X faster), leaner crypto assumptions (Fiat Shamir), post-quantum security, no trusted setup. Main disadvantage is proof size (currently \~2000X longer, or ~ 600KB; as @arielg noted it could go down, say, to 100K for ZCash statements, this is an optimistic guess, not something we've actually done yet). I also repeated that even if it's not reasonable to use STARKs for single tx's, due to their size, their scalability should be useful if/when used to aggregate many many tx's. But the very first thing that needs to be done is to get the paper published and peer reviewed, which will take some more time.

Hi @BOGDAN it looks like your transaction has 300+ 0.001 ZEC inputs! This is a very large transaction because of the inputs and many of the larger mining pools have a limit on the size of the inputs they accept.
So as a result you will need to wait for a smaller mining pool to find a block and include your transaction. To avoid this in the future, you should set your pool payout threshold higher (like .1 or 1.0) to reduce the number of inputs for your transactions https://www.reddit.com/r/zec/comments/77ach1/psa_if_you_are_a_zcash_miner_who_receives_many/

@zooko. Hey I inquired about Zcash Dark coins with Daira the other day. She said that they weren't your coins but a trademark infringement. I have to say I see a niche in sub-penny cryptos these can fill if you could apply zero knowledge proof algos. They'd take up a bit of the Dogecoin business on anonymity alone.

@jshook1986 Zcash is open source so anyone is free to use the code to make thier own coin, as many like Zen, Hush, Zero, Komodo, etc.. have done.
But they *are not* permitted to use the "Zcash" name or Zcash Trademark :ZEC: because it falsely implies that the software is somehow supported by Zcash Company (Zerocoin Electric Coin Company) https://z.cash/trademark-policy.html

Pure water doesn't conduct electricity
Dissolved baking soda provides ions that can carry current
And in this particular case, it looks like you're using it to create a conductive paste
(which can then be spread on the surface of the wood to increase surface conductivity)

I didn't know that would spark everyone's interest so much! And yes extremely dangerous! But to answer your question, no nothing was carved but with electricity. This was made with a microwave Transformer which creates very high voltage and low amperage where as a welder does the opposite. I was very leery about my brother doing this at all so that's why I kept an eye on him.

@NealJayu have they made it easy to use OB with Tor yet? That is one of my main barriers. Also I don't want to leave my desktop on all the time to keep the store online. So an easy way to run on a server (for non-sysadmin users like myself) would also be helpful.
NealJayu 12:35 PM
@durbanpoison That was a huge change with v2: you don't need to keep the client running continuously in order to have a store. You need to open it at least once per week in order to keep your listings up.
With the ZEC side, they haven't fully integrated an SPV wallet yet. So you will need to have zcashd running on your computer when you open it. And yes, Tor integration is easy with v2: just have the Tor daemon running or Tor Browser Bundle and check the 'Enable Tor' button when you connect on OpenBazaar.

@alexd88 did you leave `-reindex` in your command line or configuration file when you re-started the Node? If so that's why it's re-downloading the whole chain again, you need to remove that command. If not, then if your Node has been off for awhile then it needs to catch up to the most recent Blocks so the download should be much quicker.

@daira Heya Dev team, just my two cents on the whole trademark infringement matter with Zcash Dark on YoBit. They say it's a federal court complaint and,..."Generally, the court will consider evidence addressing various factors to determine whether there is a likelihood of confusion among consumers. The key factors considered in most cases are the degree of similarity between the marks at issue and whether the parties' goods and/or services are sufficiently related that consumers are likely to assume (mistakenly) that they come from a common source. Other factors that courts typically consider include how and where the parties' goods or services are advertised, marketed, and sold; the purchasing conditions; the range of prospective purchasers of the goods or services; whether there is any evidence of actual confusion caused by the allegedly infringing mark; the defendant's intent in adopting its mark; and the strength of the plaintiff's mark."

back to the account auditing question
so the only way to see how much ZEC was in the t-address at a particular time is to re-sync the node?
mr_aug 7:36 AM
correct me if I'm wrong, but I assume you can track all transactions on the blockchain (incoming and outgoing). Would't it be then possible to write a function which would sum up all the transactions FROM specific date TO specific date?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:21 AM
@mr_aug yes
For t-addrs, all that info is public, like in Bitcoin
You'd just need to be able to scan all transactions, which zcashd doesn't provide for by default (you need to set `txindex=1` in your zcash.conf, which will trigger a reindex)
mr_aug 9:10 AM
ok, once I have the reindexing done, how would I proceed with getting the info out of the blockchain?

Hi. I'm getting started with ZCash and I wonder whether this project has kept the OP_RETURN from bitcoin transactions? Did not find too much about it. If it is kept, does the zero-knowledge proofs also work on it? Such that one can keep the information stored in it private?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:33 AM
@espen.lund I believe `OP_RETURN` does work like Bitcoin, which means that no, `OP_RETURN` data is not private at all
You *can* however achieve the same functionality using the encrypted memo field when sending to z-addresses; that gives you 512 bytes of UTF-8 text, or 511 bytes of arbitrary data, which only the recipient can decrypt.

What is the current transaction capacity of the Zcash network?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:45 PM
@clip Zcash has a Block size of 2MB and a target block interval of 2.5min (150s).

If a block contained only Transparent (unshielded) transactions the limit would be about 26.67 tx/s for average tx size of 500 bytes.

For an average transaction size of 2000 bytes in a Shielded Transaction (JoinSplits are at least 1.5 kB IIRC, larger for more than two inputs or outputs), that's 6.67 tx/s for the targeted block interval of 150s. Keep in mind the team is working on reducing the JoinSplit size so that will only increase the max number of Shielded tx/s.

Therefore since blocks currently contain a mix of Shielded and Transparent transactions the number is (currently) somewhere between 6.67 and 26.67 transactions per second.

(These numbers quoted from Jack Grigg @str4d Zcash Developer)

Ok thank you. I can build for linux myself. But the windows is 1.0.12? according to winzec site?
So it is deprecated by default right?

@thetrunk Radix42 added the disable depreciation to the default winZEC so it will run even though it's 1.0.12. I'm not sure if it will run after Overwinter activates... ü§î

I thought he is getting paid for maintaining the windows builds... Isnt his address in the list of founder rewards? I guess Ill just write the scripts and build it myself then
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:47 AM
Btw, the master branch compiles directly on macOS (with a very slight patch in `build.sh` script). Not sure about Windows but I assume it requires some manual tweaking. I know there is an ongoing process to make zcashd cross compile and should be finalized soon.

ok I managed to build it for windows and seems like it is working as it is syncing, creating adresses, displaying them etc. So good job str4d! Strangly the zcashd has 190MB which is bigger then the one for linux ~120MB

Hi everyone!
I have 1 theorical question:
zk-SNARKs can be applied to any QAP (Quadratic Arithmetic Program). Thus, when we want to use our problem with zk-SNARK we have to "translate" (compile) it in a QAP form.
The path to follow: problem --> Algebric circuit --> RC1S-->QAP
But how to translate our problem to a RC1S form? For example, if I want to prove that I know the secret value of a transaction (like in Zcash) how can I modelize it?
tromer Zcash Foundation 11:33 AM
@toto, if you want to see how R1CS are actually constructed for various problems, a good way is to take the "Challenge Two: Crafting Constraint Systems" tutorial in http://qed-it.com/2017/07/the-hunting-of-the-snark/ .

    qed-it.com
    The Hunting of the SNARK ‚Äì QED-it

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:20 PM
so, in practice you don't write general arithmetic circuits. you write circuits in a form that is trivially equivalent to a Rank 1 Constraint System. then you apply your proving system library and hope that it gets the conversion to a QAP right (that step is not entirely trivial: https://leastauthority.com/blog/a_bug_in_libsnark/ )

@radix42 Any chance for a macZEC? üôÇ
The good thing is that macOS currently compiles directly in master with no patches. So zcashd compiles out of the box.
Indeed.
I'm sure it's lovely there. Especially during this time of year. I live in Athens, Greece, and we have kind of similar climate.

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:09 AM
Are you sure you sent this transaction from winZEC? Looks like a mining pool payout.
The reason for the delay is that the transaction has 490 inputs.
To avoid this in the future, you should set your pool payout threshold higher (like .1 or 1.0) to reduce the number of inputs for your transactions.

"how iz zcash private when the buyer has to put personal details for purchase?" <-- qaffe, privacy does not imply anonymity. Privacy means that even if you provide ID to the person or place you are buying ZEC from, as long as you are using a z-address, that place doesn't learn anything about what you later do with the ZEC, or who else you are making transactions with. And other people don't even learn that you were trading with the place you bought ZEC from.

However, I don't want to pressure mineZcash to do more work, or to do his work differently, or whatever. This rocketchat is an invaluable resource for those people (mostly developers) who are willing to log into it, and I'm grateful that he maintains it and hosts us all here.
Also note that the unwillingness to login to a chat site is even _higher_ among different groups, e.g. mainland Chinese (for whom the site may be considered unreliable due to GfW, and anyway just culturally they use Telegram and do not use special-topic chat systems).

I don't mind other platforms, there is probably a Telegram group already and there is a Discord group too. The trick is getting many users to all sign up for _any_ platform. I don't think the current level of interaction between Zcash users can sustain so many different platforms. Perhaps as we grow the focus will shift to which ever users feel most comfortable with. If that's Telegram, Discord or whatever I'm fine with that too.

@zooko His usual rants are "Zcash is a money grab", "a short term 4-year project", "won't be around in 5 years", "20% tax goes to Roger Ver", "it's centralized". So basically he says it's a centralized short term 4-year project built to last for 4 years and make money for a bunch of people out of the founders reward.

Or alternatively, `getblocktemplate` returns a fully-created coinbase transaction that includes the required Founders Reward address for that height

@ivan-1 the first block without founders' reward is block number (SlowStartShift + HalvingInterval)
where SlowStartShift = 20000 and HalvingInterval = 840000, as defined in the protocol spec

@str4d , okay, it'll be very silly question, but if i trying to start for testing my own stratum pool and i'll want to mining Zcash. So, how i can get the foundersRewardAddressChangeInterval, maxFoundersRewardBlockHeight and current FoundersRewardAddress for that height programmatically? For example, using getBlockTemplate?
str4d May 1, 2018 11:35 AM
Or alternatively, `getblocktemplate` returns a fully-created coinbase transaction that includes the required Founders Reward address for that height
Cuz i need this values for createGeneration(. Help).

@amiller gun sirer gets exactly to my point with my original comment on the forum: https://forum.z.cash/t/let-s-talk-about-asic-mining/27353/ sitting by and doing nothing _is a decision_. My biggest concern about ASICs has nothing to do with miner profitability (I think miners will naturally gravitate to the most efficient and _readily available_ equipment no matter what) but if another *Company* like Bitmain becomes majority "hash-holder" would *Zcash Company* now _have to deal with them and thier priorities_ ?

What I do not like about ASICs is that as of today Bitmain is a huge monopoly. I would like to see at least one or two other manufacturers before we allow those machines to completely centralize the Zcash mining ecosystem.
I guess the question now is if changing the equihash parameters now will (or will not) effectively block the current Bitmain machine.
If Zcash gates are going to be open for ASICs may be we need open source ASIC designs as with Bitcoin. In that case may be we need grants for open source ASICs.
Otherwise I think today's news about a new Zcash miner monopoly with Bitmain as the main dictator are really bad news.

    forum.z.cash
    Let‚Äôs talk about ASIC mining
    Something that I don‚Äôt think has been emphasised enough in the discussion so far: The Equihash parameters that Zcash selected for launch {n=200, k=9} were suboptimal. What do I mean by this? The peak memory required for optimally solving Equihash with parameters {n=200, k=9} was estimated to be much higher than it turned out to require in practice. Just before launch, the open-source mining competition successfully produced miners that required much less memory than previous implementations....

    üëç 1 

@bit Changing the Equihash parameters would almost definitely render the Z9 obsolete. The peak memory required for the current parameters is relatively low. I very much doubt that Bitmain has overengineered their ASICs to include 20x additional RAM. üôÇ

bit 12:01 PM
Thanks @jasondavies .
I guess it's obvious we should do that now until we have either an open source design for ASICs or at least two or three ASIC manufacturers
It also seems that equihash will be much more ASIC resistant with the original envisioned parameters
Which by the way Zcash said from the beginning that the equihash parameters could be changed if needed.
Well, it is clearly needed now. Unless we see a free and competitive market on the ASIC front, which is not the case right now.

Putting aside roadmap and Sapling schedule... Changing parameters is fairly straight-forward as @jasondavies posted on the forum. Here's the code that can do it: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1211#issuecomment-379882647 It needs testing of course, and most importantly, profiling of memory usage to ensure it achieves the intended goal.

With regards to forking, it's baked in now. If Zcash changes the proof-of-work (for whatever reason) which renders the Z9 obsolete, those ASIC miners/manufacturers may choose to fork, just like they did with Monero Original. What is different however is that there can only be one Zcash due to trademarks.

@zooko I'm not against centralization at this stage of Zcash growth as Derek pointed out in his very well written article: https://medium.com/@dhsue/an-analysis-of-zcash-governance-692793f9c9ef Zcash has alot of special tech that is dependent on the few in the world that know thier ways around the zkSNARKS and STARKs and such, so decentralization while growing may not be the ideal way to move the protocol forward.

Hey @zooko. I‚Äôve been mining, supporting, and contributing to the Zcash project since Dec 2016. By now I‚Äôve explained it to hundreds of people and even presented talks about it to my fellow students!

The current stance of the Zcash team is worrying. If you continue to do nothing, not only will you have screwed off every single person who decided to support, invest, and contribute to your project among hundreds of competitors, but you will also hand over everything to a foreign, obscure, and shady Chinese company focused exclusively on short term gain.

Right now, this company could tank Zcash at the flick of a switch. They either already have 51% control over the network, or can run a couple thousand boxes for an hour or two, suck up the last few drops of profitability, cause thousands of miners to drop out, and THEN gain 51% control. This is FATAL for the future prospects of Zcash.

The only way for Zcash to succeed is by having the most enthusiastic community of them all. Nothing is more important than the community. If you do nothing, every single one of these true supporters, including me, will be forced away. And mark my words, ‚Äúhands off principles‚Äù are cool and all, but without an ecstatic community, the project WILL fail.

This is really a life-or-death situation. The Z9s will be arriving at the start of July. Before July 10, you NEED to release a hard-fork with a modified algorithm. This will be a strong deterrent to Bitmain and set a critically important precedent for the future. And then, like Monero is doing, on every significant network update, further alternate/modify the algorithm to deter behind-the-scenes ASIC hoarders. And you will regain the trust, support, and enthusiasm of all the people who made your vision a reality.

If you do nothing, this centralised, greed-driven corporation will not only slowly and painfully kill off the community, but will also have the option of killing Zcash at a whim. Realise that they are based in China. They don‚Äôt even have Google there!

You may have noticed that I‚Äôm particularly emotive about this. I really don‚Äôt want Zcash to fail. Please take the reins and guide the project away from the huge crater ahead.

Also with the idea of the block reward split over 10 months, it does seem like an interesting idea. Though I wonder whether it would make things more difficult for newcomers. The current ZEC reward just about makes things profitable with the latest equipment, but receiving 1/10th of that upon mining the block will mean that miners need to take an extensive loss for a number of months. Sounds otherwise exciting though.

The only problem I have is that Bitmain has essentially mounted a 51% attack on the network. They have the majority hashing power. This is a hugely pressing issue that has to be addressed before all else IMO. @zooko

@ZK except nothing like the current financial system. Low fees, fast transactions, keep your information private, no middle man to deny your transaction across the globe, etc... Don't get me wrong, I think Zcash should remain ASIC resistant for the reasons I explained above, but the PoW is something that miners and enthusiasts like us care about more than an average user. If we get to the point of Zcash being used in every day transactions, most user's will only care about the quality of the coins privacy protections/speed/etc and choose to use it because Bitcoin and others don't offer privacy, they won't be concerned about the hardware they never see.
ZK 11:40 AM
@mineZcash ‚ÄúLow fees, fast transactions‚Äù the current system doesn‚Äôt have this? For Zcash to succeed, ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù is not acceptable. If the community is driven away, it will fail. If the enthusiasts divert their attention elsewhere, it will fail. The ‚Äúaverage users‚Äù will get involved years down the line, and depend entirely on the enthusiasts of today not abandoning the project. I can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs reasonable for one Chinese company to, on paper, control the entire network.
Sure, the transactions may remain private, but what use is that after the value tanks and developers abandon it?

I think the bigger barriers to adoption need to be fixed to also build a community and userbase. Zcash has lots of hurdles to cross like proper Windows/Mac support, Lite Wallets for Mobile Private transactions, simple to use GUI for stores and consumers, etc. The upcoming upgrades like Overwinter and Sapling are tackling those head on.
So Zcash will certainly continue to grow, and I think the Development team hears the community's opinion loud and clear when it comes to ASICs. We will just have wait to see how things shake out with this, they just announced them _yesterday_ so give it some time.

TBH I am surprised at how numerous, and how thoughtful are the posters on https://forum.z.cash/t/let-s-talk-about-asic-mining/27353/809 who are arguing against the "Must Anti-ASIC Now!" position. People have been telling me that the vast majority of community members posting to the thread are in the "Must Anti-ASIC Now!" position, but that's not what I've seen in reading about 100 of the posts (out about about 900 currently).

    forum.z.cash
    Let‚Äôs talk about ASIC mining
    The only reason the community has rallied around a POW change is because their speculative investment in GPU‚Äôs is threatened. Zcash is already monopolized by two companies! So if there is one more company out there that produced ASIC miners then everything would be okay? Because there only needs to be one more to be exactly like CPU (AMD and Intel) and GPU (Nvidia and AMD) manufacturers. There are only three companies that are the major producers of said items. IMO 90% of the people here only...

Anyway, going back to reading through some of the most recent posts‚Ä¶
Hey can anyone make a graph of hashpower divided by current price over time? One for XMR and one for ZEC? Thanks. üôÇ

Also, I really don't want to be mean here, but if someone is, sort of, lashing out, or accusing others, or spreading conspiracy theories, or they say that they've sold all their Zcash and retargeted their miners because of this, I really don't feel like our community is worse off for having an outflow of such people. I don't wish them harm, and I don't think they're bad people, but I also feel like in the long run our community is either no worse off, or actually better off, from such people losing faith in Zcash.
OTOH sincere and thoughtful people who say this will kill their ability/interest in continuing to be part of Zcash, I'm definitely motivated to try to keep as many of them as we can.

@zooko Regarding POW. If the pro-ASIC argument is of stronger security (which really would not be so if there is only one manufacturer) and regarding the possibility of a dual POW, then it will make more sense to have an SHA ASIC merged mining with Bitcoin and an Equihash (144, 5 -or lower) for GPU/CPU.
This way Zcash will get both the strong security of the existing ASIC Bitcoin network, through merged mining, where there are several ASIC manufacturers present, plus the cypherpunk ideals of everyone able to mine Zcash with widely available machines.
Really, having equihash open to ASICs makes no sense.
If the ASIC gates are to be opened at all, which needs more reflection, that should be a safer way to do it.

@bitcartel, an essential difference between SETI@home etc. and PoW is that the latter is zero-sum due to difficulty adjustment...

jacksee 11:11 PM
We will not allow that to happen.

ASIC-resistance is central to our mission. Bitcoin Gold, BTG, was conceived while watching the struggle between ASIC miners and the rest of the Bitcoin community. The fundamental reason for BTG‚Äôs creation was to help wrest back the crypto space from the relentlessly monopolizing tendencies of ASIC mining. How? By returning mining power to commodity hardware that is more universally accessible to people around the world: GPUs, or ‚Äúgraphics cards,‚Äù which nearly anyone can acquire and use.

This idea lives on in the original ‚Äúcode name‚Äô for the project ‚Äì BTCGPU ‚Äì which is still the name of our GitHub code repository: BTCGPU.

We chose the PoW (‚ÄúProof of Work‚Äù) algorithm Equihash for the launch of BTG ‚Äì an algorithm that Zcash first worked to develop and implement ‚Äì because it was designed with the express intent of achieving a high degree of ASIC-resistance. The retail emergence of an Equihash-specific miner demonstrates that Equihash, as implemented today, is not as ASIC-resistant as necessary.
The Bitcoin Gold dev team is now working to fix this.

We‚Äôve been planning to do this for some time ‚Äì either by modifying how the Equihash algorithm is implemented, or by changing to an entirely different algorithm. Perhaps we‚Äôll do each, over time.

The Monero team recently demonstrated that this works. When a Monero-mining ASIC was being released by Bitmain in March, the Monero developers changed their code to make those miners ineffective. We applaud their actions ‚Äì and their success!

We‚Äôll be releasing an upgrade to Bitcoin Gold in cooperation with the many partners in our ecosystem ‚Äì including not just our own open-source projects, but also working with the developers of third-party wallets, mining pools, mining software, exchanges, various businesses relying on running full nodes‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre even working with ASIC researchers who are assisting us in understanding the problems and how to best address them. Our solutions and code will be, as always, free and open-source to the crypto community at large. We‚Äôll be releasing a more detailed plan in the coming weeks, providing plenty of advance notice so that none of our partners are taken by surprise.

The goal is to have no (or minimal) impact on the users and current GPU-based miners of BTG, apart from the need to upgrade certain software. We believe the BTG ecosystem will be ready to switch over to the upgraded version in approximately two months, and there is no expectation that this will result in an unintentional stray blockchain fork or alternate version of BTG.

We know this may not be a ‚Äúone and done‚Äù solution. Our upgrade will make the current crop of miners useless for mining BTG, but this does not prevent them (or others) from trying again. Like the Monero team, the Bitcoin Gold Organization is committed to repeating this process as necessary. (The Monero approach is currently to plan a change of algorithm every six months. Our current plan is to make changes as the need appears.)

In time, anyone buying BTG-specific miners will learn that their investment is always lost, and the producers of this hardware will see that huge spending to develop custom hardware doesn‚Äôt lead to the profits they‚Äôre hoping to grab.

We‚Äôll ensure that the ability to mine BTG is always available to anyone with access to a GPU ‚Äì staying true to our mission, and keeping our promise to the BTG Community.

Carrying the torch forward, we are
The Bitcoin Gold Organization

I have a question, when I buy zcash from a brokerage house that broker buys zcash from somewhere else to resell me?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:31 AM
In theory, they have it in stock. They don't use exchanges. In practice, they could have contracts with several whales that provide them with instant liquidity.

Hey guys, has anyone ever experienced issues with stopping the zcash daemon?
After using stop() JSON-RPC, zcashd eats 100% of CPU even though log says: Shutdown: In progress...
StopRPC: waiting for async rpc workers to stop
StopNode()
"Shutdown: done" appears after ~15 minutes..I guess something in StopNode() is bugged?
mstrokin 6:04 AM
Actually it hangs after "Shutdown:done" as well

I'm having some trouble getting winzec to connect to the testnet, and am also having trouble debugging it
can somebody assure me that there is definitely a healthy testnet running that I should have no trouble connecting to
and are there any weird gotchas involved

I've done this successfully for a half dozen other wallets for other currencies
garethtdavies 1:59 PM
testnet is working fine. What's in the conf file?
gfredericks 2:00 PM
I've tried a variety of things;

mostly

```
addnode=testnet.z.cash
testnet=1
...


```

garethtdavies 2:01 PM
Here's the testnet explorer (confirming everything is good) https://explorer.testnet.z.cash/

What version of WinZEC do you have?
gfredericks 2:04 PM
how do I determine that?
garethtdavies 2:04 PM
or rather what version of zcashd has been bundled with it?
gfredericks 2:05 PM
v1.1.0-4b5bb87b1-dirty
what ports need to be open for the testnet?
krunch3r 2:08 PM
have you tried explicitly setting the location of the conf file? zcashd -conf=<dir>
gfredericks 2:08 PM
yes
krunch3r 2:08 PM
<dir><file>
have you removed references to mainnet?
gfredericks 2:10 PM
from the conf file, yes
does testnet use 18233 while mainnet uses 8233?

sonya Admin Zcash Foundation 2:13 PM
Question from Twitter that I don't know the answer to:

"Is there something like Metamask but for sending ZCash?"

I asked: "Hmm, specifically the dapp browser-integration role of metamask?"

They clarified: "Not necessarily - I'm more thinking something that can send
OP_RETURN-esque transactions with t addresses."
gfredericks 2:14 PM
@krunch3r oh good question; trying now
yes, it seems to work
cli reports one connection and hundreds of blocks
krunch3r 2:15 PM
going forward, you may want to make sure to specify the data directory as well as the conf directory, and different for mainnet and testnet. zcashd -datadir=<dir>
gfredericks 2:16 PM
I'm actually not intending to use the mainnet in general
krunch3r 2:16 PM
you can always install debian via docker on windows.. there is a repo for the zcash deb . i am running docker on linux myself but same difference.
gfredericks 2:16 PM
should passing `-testnet` to the daemon and cli be sufficient, or is the config file really necessary?
debian/docker/etc. isn't an option for me I don't think
krunch3r 2:17 PM
probably is since docker is available for windows
oh, lack of linux experience?
gfredericks 2:17 PM
for other reasons, not technical reasons
krunch3r 2:18 PM
i'll see if i can connect to testnet myself in a few for more certainty
gfredericks 2:19 PM
I think right now I need to wait to have 18233 opened up in the firewall
I'm not convinced that's my only problem, but I think it's almost certainly part of the problem
garethtdavies 2:19 PM
I just connected to testnet on my WinZEC machine so can confirm it works as intended
krunch3r 2:19 PM
oh ok. maybe if you two use the same binary üôÇ
gfredericks 2:21 PM
thanks for the help; I will come back if it still doesn't work after the port is opened
krunch3r 2:21 PM
v1.1.0-4b5bb87b1-dirty -> gfredericks .... ? ->gareth
an i dunno about -testnet personally
but if you two run the same version with the same command line options, that would rule out an issue with a specific compile
@sonya may also want to relay your question to #zcash-wizards as this channel seems more like the water cooler area of the office
sonya Admin Zcash Foundation 2:26 PM
will do, ty üôÇ
garethtdavies 2:32 PM
Yes that exact version. I just updated my conf file with testnet settings (and a different datadir)
krunch3r 2:34 PM
cool, gfredericks should make sure the specify a datadir like you did . and maybe make all other things the same such as options in the conf file. that would rule out a conf issue.
gfredericks 2:35 PM
üëç
krunch3r 2:36 PM
i think that's gfredericks saying yeah, let's see that working conf
and i dunno how the conf is being read, gfredericks, you can try using an editor that allows you to save in unix format
that would rule out a format issue that is inherent to the two different operating systems but may not always be accounted for
gfredericks 2:41 PM
oh that's an interesting question
not sure why that wouldn't affect any other winzec user though
krunch3r 2:41 PM
unless the other user is using an editor to save in unix format
are you aware of the differences?
gfredericks 2:41 PM
yes
UTF-16+BOM vs UTF-8, I assume
krunch3r 2:42 PM
no, all characters are accounted for
each line has an additional special character at the end in dos format to signify the carriage return. that's why some files load in windows without "line feeds"
gfredericks 2:42 PM
oh right that too
krunch3r 2:44 PM
a truly portable program needs to account for that difference when reading lines from a file. it may be done automatically by the compiler depending on the language and the specific function used, or it may not be.
you can try notepad++ , i recall it has the option to save in unix format, or reformat without CR right in its "edit" menu or thereabouts
gfredericks 2:45 PM
that part I can figure out
krunch3r 2:47 PM
maybe if you start a thread on the forum notes can be compared there. looks like gareth has stepped out. or try again at #zcash-dev
gfredericks 2:47 PM
still waiting on the port to be opened
krunch3r 2:49 PM
i just connected to testnet and started downloading blocks, but the port i did not open
on linux
maybe your firewall is blocking connections to the ip address that corresponds to the testnet ... also, i don't need to add the line to my conf file
addnode=testnet.z.cash, just testnet=1 is sufficient
ping testnet.z.cash to make sure you can reach it
@gfredericks can you ping testnet.z.cash ?
gfredericks 3:19 PM
I'm pretty sure the firewall is blocking that port, since we have a whitelist firewall

pinging did work though
krunch3r 3:20 PM
on the linux implementation things run without complaint whether or not the WAN can reach the port
what exactly is the error ?
gfredericks 3:22 PM
there's no indication of a problem aside from the connections are 0 and the blocks are 0; the daemon log shows some activity but nothing alarming; almost as if it's just not finding anybody to talk to
krunch3r 3:24 PM
well you can get your hands dirty with tcp sniffing to rule out the firewall blocking outbound connections to a different port (as it seems to have been set up for the mainnet port in the very least) . or check your firewall settings on the user interface without getting too dirty.
program specific blocking vs ping
which the firewall may not be blocking (ping is probably default to okay all outbound ports)
in other words, make sure you software firewall hasn't just approved one port for outbound connections on that executable
gfredericks 3:27 PM
the firewall is completely out of my control
thus the waiting
krunch3r 3:29 PM
so, ping tells us you can "ping" to that ip, but it does not try to connect to any ports. you should have your administrator check your outbound ports. maybe the port number is on an exclude range. it is much more than 8233 after all.
opening the inbound will not be enough and firewall rules can be this specific!
gfredericks 3:30 PM
right; I'm asking for 18233 to be opened in both directions
krunch3r 3:31 PM
good
gfredericks 3:31 PM
sounds like everything has been open outbound this whole time; it was only the inbound that needed opening
which is surprising
krunch3r 3:32 PM
i don't need inbound open on linux to connect...
so that would be surprising
my money is still on 18233 outbound rejected
unless you have confirmation
gfredericks 3:33 PM
and now it's working üòÆ

Hi,
I'm thinking of a proposal for the Zcash Foundation and I'd like to get some feedback here before I list it in https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/GrantProposals-2018Q2/issues . My idea is to integrate Zcash with Mojaloop ( https://leveloneproject.org/mojaloop/ || http://mojaloop.io ).
According to documentation, "Mojaloop also uses the Interledger Protocol to choreograph secure money transfers. " ( https://github.com/interledger ).
I still need to look into the details of this integration, but I wanted to ask here for feedback/input on a possible architecture, say, for a banking application with Zcash+ Mojaloop. How would a Zcash wallet fit into the architecture?
I'm also trying to think "holistically". That is, I'm trying to think what is a good scope for a proposal besides the technical stuff. For instance, I may propose a "deployment" initiative to go to a poor community and bootstrap the use of Zcash+Mojaloop, perhaps with the help of existing local community associations, a Computer Science student and a Sociologist from a local university.
Any general feedback?

Lets not forget we are in a way competing with Bitcoin, Bcash, Dash and Litecoin. Zcash hashrate is amateur. GPU miners want to protect their investment which is cool but can't possibly care about the security of the network comparing Zcash hash rate to it's competitors.
and no I did not buy a Z9
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:56 PM
@kjn311 I agree that Zcash is competing against other coins, but none of the coins you mentioned use Equihash algorithm so the total H/s is not directly comparable.
But if you do look at every other coin that uses Equihash, Zcash has by far the highest network hashrate of any other Equihash coin.

Censorship - an official who examines material that is about to be released, such as books, movies, news, and art, and suppresses any parts that are considered obscene, politically unacceptable, or a threat to security. Bitmain isn't the best player but I personally feel the new thought of censorship of ASIC in our environment goes against the spirit of the whole movement.
but hey either way I'm holding ZEC. I just think the increase hash rate will look good for Zcash.
acmeloon 10:06 PM

    [BOUNTY] New guide: zcash <3 tor: installing, running, and updating Zcash over Tor on a Debian server
    Hello, I am working on a new guide for installing, running, and updating Zcash over Tor on a Debian server. The hardware I am using is a Bitseed 3 server. It normally runs Bitcoin but it has a lot of room on the hard drive so I decided to try installing Zcash too. I like my privacy, so I decided to try doing everything over Tor. There were a surprisingly large amount of resources already available on the subject, including a hidden service that I could download the Zcash software from. But ther...

Something is fishy for sure üôÇ
I would try the following:

1. Shut down zcashd and winZEC. Make sure both processes are stopped.
2. Move the wallet.dat file to another folder (like the Desktop).
3. Launch winZEC. It will launch as an empty new wallet.
4. Now import all your private keys manually.

This should bring you to a clean state, assuming your wallet.dat file is somehow corrupt.

@jora Confirmed transactions cannot be reversed.
Since the transaction is confirmed in the block explorer, it means the problem is on the receiver's side.
jora 11:04 AM
Tell me please, this transaction is confirmed exactly ?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 11:05 AM
Yes, this is a perfectly valid transaction. Nothing is wrong from your side. The problem is on the receiver's side.

What do you think, what could be the problem with the recipient of the account ? Thx
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:02 PM
Who is the recipient? Is it a user or an exchange? If it's a user, which wallet are they using? If it's an exchange, you need to contact their customer support and show them the blockchain explorer transaction. This proves that the transaction is sent and is valid.

mineZcash Admin Owner 5:53 AM
@mycookie (OFTC) @cookie What do you mean by "copy Blockchain data"? if you just want to move your funds to a new wallet (assuming you are running a full node) you can easily move your wallet.dat file to the new node.
The IP of the old node will not be copied over since it's not recorded on the chain or in the wallet. But Zcash doesn't hide your IP from the network by default, so if you connect your new node to the network other nodes can see the new nodes IP when you sync up.
So if you are concerned about your IP being "seen" by others on the network then you should connect via a VPN or Tor. Community members have instructions about how to connect via Tor here: https://forum.z.cash/t/set-up-guide-for-running-zcash-on-tor-ubuntu-debian-linux-desktop/18748

How can I use z_exportwallet / dumpwallet with variable path? I dont want to specify the path in starting zcashd or putting exportdir=PATH into config. Is there an option to choose the path while zcashd is running?

You mean programmatically? Because otherwise you could just copy the wallet.dat file to any location.

@louis-1 I guess the Zcash community governance process is supposed to determine that. I guess the ballot item "Does the community support ASIC-resistance?" on the ballot would influence the Foundation's decision about that, but then there's also the "Make an ASIC-friendly, generic, widely-supported PoW" alternative item. Also I'm not at all sure that I want the Zcash Company to do what the Foundation decides about this. Bottom line: nobody knows.

louis-1 7:56 AM
@zooko - Many thanks for your reply and detailed explanation, from which I can see it's not an easy question to answer re ASIC, as from reading the below link you've kindly included and links from other users, zcash wants to be all inclusive re widespread adaption, which is perfectly understand and also the whole purpose of being decentralised where many many /miners / users / community members have a say and vote. However, in my opinion and what I need clarification on is how to ensure that small /medium gpu miners have a level paying field to mine from, ie. 1 mining rig of 6 gpu's is the same as 1 ASIC card. Right now 6x 1070's standard clock mining zec = 2.70 kh/s for 900w, whereas to my understand 1 ASIC card = 50 kh/s for 600 w (tbc?). Yes there is a huge price difference (i.e. ¬£2/3k vs 9k+ in this example), however, it can be abused so that only a small group of users control 50+ % of the blockchain re mining and thus control the future direction of zec! This means that Zec becomes ultimately nor decentralised, which is not the point I believe correct me if I'm wrong of why crypto currencies were born from the 2007 / 2008 crash, crypto currencies were born precisely because financial institutions (minority group of influential users) controlled the many. Given this, know it's a difficult question to answer, so thank you for spending the time in replying to me in the first place, and I'm not sure currently if it's possible to put something in place via the blockchain to ensure that everyone still has 1 vote each, if that could or is indeed being implemented at this time that would be the best outcome in ensuring that Zec remains decentralised, in light of the ASIC cards being delivered to market. Best Louis

Thank you for the feedback, Louis. I don't think there is a way to make the protocol provide one vote to each person. But on the bright side, I don't think the miners get control of the protocol, even if they have > 51% of the hashpower.

Hello Zooko, That's good news re miners don't control the protocol thank you - I was just thinking of the long term re allowing miners to continue POW in a decentralised fashion, one that understands that ASIC will be used having short their lifespan is for Zcash (Equihash) mining, but at the same time rewards all miners equally, that would be the ultimate goal or outcome! üôÇ

Are there any tools, for other coins, intended to help end-users provide such traces _within their own accounts_?
It would be great if there was such a tool for Zcash, supporting shielded transactions and payment disclosures. (Especially if Zcash was the first to have one!)
This would be a really strong example of how Zcash is regulator/compliance-friendly *and* privacy-preserving.

I assumed it would be: block reward * share difficulty / network difficulty

I am confused, after nExpiryHeight in coinbase_tx I see extra 4 bytes (0s) what is it?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:33 PM
@sammy007 what version is the transaction?
sammy007 3:33 PM
3
bc expire height is only in 3 version. Just adjusting my parser and after i have added `header` and `nVersionGroupId` and `expiryHeight` my tx is still missing 4 bytes in the end.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:35 PM
So the format should be:

```
header
nVersionGroupId
len(vin)
vin
len(vout)
vout
nLockTime
nExpiryHeight
len(vJoinSplit)
[ more only if len(vJoinSplit) > 0 ]

```

@sammy007 Yes. Sapling transactions will need to encode the new and exciting Sapling proofs (fast and low memory). This is version=4; Overwinter is version=3.

`new and exciting Sapling proofs` reminds me apple marketing. So onyl switch to 4 from 3 in a header and also use sapling group ID?
jasondavies 9:36 AM
I'll take that as a compliment. üôÇ I'm not sure I understand your last question. Sapling transactions have version=4, and they can encode a whole bunch of new information (Sapling spend descriptions).
BTW, testnet just activated Sapling a few hours ago. Testing is ongoing.
sammy007 9:38 AM
What its the difference between overwinter coinbase tx and sapling coinbase tx? Only ver 4 & group id or anything else?
ok, nm, found a ZIP

    üëç 1 

sammy007 9:47 AM
I mined a block with coinbase-txn from getblocktemplate and got `bad-sapling-root-in-block`
jasondavies 9:48 AM
Interesting. BTW, testnet has accidentally forked, because some people had not downloaded the latest Sapling parameters. Correct block number right now is 253055.
Could be a bug in getblocktemplate, I will check.
sammy007 9:49 AM
Yes `253056` on my side.

    üëç 1 

and i installed shit recently so I am sure my params are fresh.
100% a bug in GBT
jasondavies 9:50 AM
How are you building the block?
The block now also needs to include the sapling root in place of `hashReserved`.
sammy007 9:52 AM
ah, damn it, true.
jasondavies 9:52 AM
It is returned by GBT under `finalsaplingroothash`
sammy007 9:52 AM
But I see no info about this block format change in a ZIP. Only tx format.
jasondavies 9:54 AM
This change appears to be included in the protocol spec (sapling.pdf): https://github.com/zcash/zips/tree/master/protocol

sammy007 9:56 AM
I have been looking at zip-0243 only. Thx.
sammy007 10:05 AM
@jasondavies @str4d worth updating stratum spec to include saplingroothash and clarify if we have to reverse it or not, since there is already a mess with reversing.
jasondavies 10:06 AM
Yep, good point.
sammy007 10:07 AM
well, I see "encoded as in block header" so seems reverse is required.
jasondavies 10:08 AM
Yeah, I think best to keep it consistent with the other 32-byte fields.
sammy007 10:11 AM
well, mined a block finally.
so I can assume that the only change for pools is: change version to 4, change group id, set `reverse(finalSaplingRootHash)` from GBT instead of reserved zeros.
jasondavies 10:13 AM
Yep.
sammy007 10:13 AM
and indeed a coinbase tx format also requires a change if manually crafted.
sammy007 10:44 AM
@jasondavies still not clear how coinbasetxn must look like, I see a 10 byte difference in lenght with overwinter tx and nothing about what fields must be included in its data in a `zip-0243`. The ZIP202 was pretty clear but this one is kinda not complete.
jasondavies 10:46 AM
I will check, one second.
sammy007 10:46 AM
in other words need a difference between v3 and v4
jasondavies 10:49 AM
Probably best to look at sapling.pdf, section 7.1 is pretty clear on transaction fields.

What is the political appettite for segwit in zcash?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:19 PM
@chris_stewart_5 I've not heard of anything explicitly regarding Segwit in Zcash. I do believe it would be difficult to incorporate with a high degree of privacy. Have you heard of BOLT, private payment channels?

chris_stewart_5 7:23 PM
@mineZcash @zooko Do you have a good reason not to implement segwit specifically? It seems to me that is the tried and true path at this point, and diverging from this is probably riskier. Plus that would add more nuisance specific to zcash that doesn't *really* enhance the functionality of the network. So bitcoin *and* lightning developers will have a harder time being onboarded onto zcash (have to learn your specific version of segwit). Plus script versioning in general seems like a good idea. And you can add new serialization schemes without a hard fork (maybe you consider this bad).
Maybe this is a more philosophical debate of where zcash is going though. Is it going to keep adding the "good" ideas from bitcoin? Or just diverge completely into it's own implementation

@str4d Ironically I came across your marker byte and flag byte comment in the bitcoin-s generators üôÇ. I think we could just adjust the marker byte to `0xff`?

@sonya this Github issue is very relevant https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3328 - it seems that zcashd will be put into safe mode for non-Overwinter compatible clients before Overwinter activates (timescale seems to be the only thing up for debate) so it won't be possible to transact on the old chain unless `-disablesafemode` is explicitly placed into the config file (and that isn't done by default even for old version of ZCash4Win). So I think that risk is relatively slim - it's probably more going to result in a bit of confusion when some clients just stop working particularly for those using GUI wallets (like ZCash4Win)

Not 16 weeks after the fork, no. Auto-senescence kicks in for all affected versions *before* the activation height. In other words, the software that would have been on the fork won't run at all by default.

Hello, I have a couple questions I was hoping someone could answer. After the upgrade to Sapling will the protocol still rely somewhat on Sprout's trusted set up? What I mean is, if we were skeptical of sprouts trusted set up, but we were 100% confident about Saplings is it safe to say we no longer need to worry about Sprout? Also, I assume there could be a hardfork here as well

thetrunk 10:45 AM
Those who want open source wants to build it by themselves. So if you are providing an msi or exe file, the guys downloading it dont mind if it is open source, still need to trust an entity - either its Zel Technologies with ZelTreZ wallet or you. In that case I think it is much wiser to trust a company then 1 person.
ZelTreZ is not signed because the company formation is in proccess and should be established anytime soon. Therefore we are still unable to obtain a certificate.
Swing wallet is a not direct competitor to ZelTreZ.
Server cost? You can host those binaries on github, you do not have to run your own explorer nor host the proving keys. So in that case 0. In other case you are very good with 20$ a month for all of it with a very satisfying infrastrucure.
I dont think I am trolling. I am helping the ZCash community for free. So why dont work together?
MSI (exe) file can be easily built from it. I dont see any hard work behind it.
I personally dont think that there will be any change needed for Sapling once it comes in Fall. But we will see. Not a problem as of now and nothing major for sure.
ZENCash is doing great job on the swing wallet and looks like they are continuing its support. So porting it to ZCash is very easy as I demonstrated.

What is the hard work then? I think it is providing the zcash binaries especially for windows and mac. But that is now correctly integrated into zcash and so there is no hard work to be done to have swing wallet working and provide a basically free support for it.

1-2k downloads a day looks a lot to me and I dont think it is a correct number. Also providing 1/3 error is degradating my trust to it.

The root of this problem and why I stepped in is your constant begging for money and not delivering any work. Less talk more work!

Let's not take things to personally guys, Radix has done a lot of work for the Zcash Community. I don't think it's an even comparison since the ZelTrez wallet also has a token associated with it. Where WinZEC is an open source port of also open-source core Zcash code.

If foundation is interested in open sourcing a zcash pool which I developed 1 week before mainnet launch and now supporting it for a few private users I am all ears. Overwinter and sapling ready. It's written in go, emberjs frontend, PROP reward system, payouts. I would add that it very unlikely will change anything in network distribution because time already up, market is settled but will be very useful for big and mid range farms if they are currently pool mining and would like to switch to their own pool.

OK. Are you asking whether the safe mode alert will be relayed ad infinitum for legacy versions, versus having a set time limit for when it is relayed? I'm guessing it will have some kind of time limit, though I'm not sure how long exactly it should be active for.
rrol 4:45 AM
Yes that is what I am asking
Can't see anything about a time limit either
Just curious
jasondavies 4:49 AM
An alert was used in April 2017 for legacy versions 1.0.3-1.0.8. I think the expiry was pretty lengthy (6 months).
rrol 4:49 AM
Oh interesting
So you could mine the chain, but not send transactions, right?
Am writing an article on Overwinter for CoinDesk, just curious because as an upgrade it paves the way to zcash as a "consensual cryptocurrency" but then there's this safe mode feature, which shuts down the legacy chain... is that cos the legacy chain doesn't have replay protection? Or am I wrong to conflate this things?
jasondavies 4:54 AM
@rrol Overwinter has replay protection; that's not a problem. See here: https://z.cash/upgrade/overwinter.html

rrol 4:59 AM
@str4d so this is important, that safe mode isn't 'enforced' per se

But yes for sure
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:02 AM
The use of safe-more for old releases is specifically about protecting users who for some reason or another didn't realise there was an upgrade coming, and who might face economic harm if they transact around the activation height without having upgraded.

jasondavies 5:03 AM
Note that Zcash users have already been encouraged to keep their clients updated via the auto-senescence feature. The discussion in that ticket about using the alert system is quite interesting and gives the nuances about whether is should be used or not for this particular network upgrade (this is the first for Zcash, but there are more to come).

@rrol are you writing another article beyond the one that posted on CoinDesk this morning?

yes just a generic Overwinter article, 'what do expect'
*to
and there's a third one also
on the governance panel
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:10 AM
I don't understand the first question.
As for the second one, the Overwinter network upgrade is specifically intended to make future network upgrades safer, so by definition there is more risk during its rollout than for future network upgrades, since some of the features it introduces can't be leveraged for itself.
But I think the overall risk is pretty low
rrol 5:10 AM
thank you, that's interesting
re: miners, whenever we're analyzing a fork, we look at the various stakeholders. as GPU miners represent a large, disenfranchised faction, i was wondering if you anticipate any trouble
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:12 AM
Partly because we intentionally limited its feature-set (to make the overall upgrade simpler), and partly because the one feature we *did* include that is not NU-related is to fix the quadratic hashing bug, so there is good incentive for the network to support it in order to improve performance for transparent transactions with many inputs.
rrol 5:12 AM
interesting
appreciate it
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:13 AM
Oh, and while I have you here:
From the article posted this morning:

    > Not only does Overwinter add so-called "replay protection," but it also eliminated some code called "auto-senescence," which causes nodes running older versions of the software to shutdown after a period of 16 weeks.

That's incorrect.
rrol 5:14 AM
oh
hmm
what's the correct version?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:15 AM
EOS halt (which used to be named auto-senescence) is still in the codebase; its one part of our strategy for safe network upgrades.
rrol 5:16 AM
oh weird i was so sure that was one of the ZIPs
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:18 AM

*consensual
jasondavies 5:22 AM
It's open source, so if you want to develop your own fork, you are free to do so. But if you read that ticket, permanent use of EOS is intended to simplify the relationship between Zcash and its users: the _default_ state of the Zcash client is to require that you keep your software up-to-date (which by extension means following the Zcash protocol updates, which are supported by the latest versions of the software).

@rrol I don't think this sentence is accurate >The Zcash Foundation, which hard-coded in a so-called "founder's fee" that contributes a small percentage of each transaction to the founders fund, has a recurring grant program.
rrol 6:49 AM
that should have been changed, if you refresh the article
EDIT 2 (12.15 UTC June 22, 2018): A former version of this article falsely stated that the Zcash Foundation was "hard coded" funds from the founders fee. This is incorrect. The Zcash Foundation is a recipient of the founders fee, but only by donation.

tromer Zcash Foundation 7:30 AM
There was no full submission on that one, and the deadline has long passed, so it won't be funded in this round of the grants.
The consensus is that it's an excellent idea in principle, and the Zcash Foundation would love to support Monero-led projects that are pertinent to our mission to enable financial privacy; but at the moment there aren't concrete and suitable projects on the table.

A couple of notes on that same sentence: the Founders' fee is actually a percentage of the block mining reward, not of every transaction. So it's directly born by miners, not users.
The last sentence, specifically.
I think it's more accurate to think of the Founders' Reward (like all other new unit issuance) as a wealth transfer from holders of the currency to the recipients.

I think you're both right and you're both wrong, somehow. Not sure what I think.
Yeah okay I think the "wealth transfer from holders to new recipient" is righter.
And the question of a Founder's Reward or Dev Fund is: shall we transfer some of the wealth from holders to founders or from holders to devs instead of from holders to miners?

To make sure I understand, is this because any new issuance dilutes the current percentage stake of all existing holders?

zooko Electric Coin Company 3:49 PM
Yep. That's my mental model as well (although I was confused about it before Nathan reminded me, above). Creating new coins out of thin air is a _transfer_ of value _from all of the previous holders_ to the new recipient. Not a creation of value.

@useragent Sure, you could create a private key, send ZEC to the corresponding address, then hand people slips of paper with the private key, which they would then have to import into some wallet supporting import - exact capability/steps depends on the recipients' wallets, but it's technically possible, analogous to doing the same with Bitcoin

@kqlsqq your funds should be fine after the Fork, I believe Nano has updated
garethtdavies 6:32 PM
@mineZcash do you know if a firmware upgrade is required? I can't find anything on their site which is a little worrisome.
gojomo 6:36 PM
an HW 'wallet' like the Ledger Nano really just has the keys & a mini-signing app - it doesn't even remember balances/tx-outs/etc, instead relying on some other usually light-ish desktop/web wallet, using some shared blockchain service, to do that - so it's possible no firmware update needed
also means an error like some red "sending failed" message could be due to a transient outage in the shared service - might need to take up with ledger support. (in any case, getting a "sending failed" now can't be due to an overwinter fork that hasn't happened yet)
garethtdavies 6:41 PM
Right, OK. This post from Daira in the forums expects them to need a firmware update but an official clarification one way or the other would help alleviate any confusion (which there obviously is) https://forum.z.cash/t/ledger-nano-s-and-overwinter-fork/29694/4?u=garethtdavies

    forum.z.cash
    Ledger Nano S and Overwinter fork
    It sounds like you got answered by a first-level tech support person who didn‚Äôt know they supported Zcash, so obviously wouldn‚Äôt know about whether they‚Äôve prepared a firmware update. I‚Äôm sure a firmware update is necessary, so yes, good idea to check your seed is properly backed up. I‚Äôll try to get a proper answer from Ledger.

gojomo 6:44 PM
I suspect whether they'd actually need a firmware update would depend on how any Overwinter replay-protection interacts with their prior "please sign *this* transaction" protocol - is the Overwinter transaction type sufficiently different that most such wallets would've needed to firmware-update?

    ü§î 1 

garethtdavies 6:47 PM
Yeah I don't know but a simple statement such as "we have upgraded at our side and you don't need to do anything" or "you must upgrade to xxx in order to transact on the Overwinter chain" would go a long way. I don't follow on Twitter so maybe this has been done and I simply missed it.

Unfortunately, there is nothing to complain about. Someone, somehow, got access to your private keys and spent them.

I guess by running pre-overwinter nodes

Probably no way via my CLI
Yeah, old node and find peers

getchaintips should show forks seen by your node
but the network will only fork if some large miner uses a pre-overwinter node which is unlikely

we are missing some miners - looks like
peter_zcash 8:37 PM

Did we ever figure out who the top "new" t addresses were/are?
peter_zcash 8:38 PM
no
at least not conclusively
if they don't publicly disclose or add a tag to their coinbase tx it is not really possible to identify them

somebody should check if there is any significant solution rate on the pre-overwinter chain

hi, everyone‚úã .I see that after submit block i'm getting zcash not imediately, i'm waiting for at least 3 hours , before zcash block reward will be on my wallet. So, i'm very interested in why in happens? I think, that founders and users, maybe, can help me... thank you very much).
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:55 AM
@ivan-1 The transaction probably has a lot of inputs. Try setting your pool payout to a lower threshold.
ivan-1 2:59 AM
@dimitris.apostolou I'm sorry but what "Try setting your pool payout to a lower threshold" means? Please, explain me what do you mean and how it can help. thank You very much).

@ivan-1 The transaction probably has a lot of inputs. Try setting your pool payout to a lower threshold.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 3:01 AM
It means that if, for example, you have selected to be payed by your pool every time you have mined 1 ZEC, you could try changing that to 0,1 or something like that. Being payed every 1 ZEC etc requires a lot of inputs which make the transaction confirmation slower.
ivan-1 3:29 AM
@dimitris.apostolou Okay, so how many inputs have a block reward (12.5 zec) ? And how long it will be processing?

    With the founders reward, zcash is a regulatable security. More fun, I will be publishing a paper on how law enforcement can trace it later this year. Sorry. Privacy is more than what computer geeks think it is. Oh, I used to do forensics for the Fed's. Not so hard.

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 8:10 AM
@ivan-1 It is not the amount that causes the delay but the inputs. You could get 12.5 ZEC instantly. But if you are in a pool that pays you incrementally, they keep adding inputs in a transaction until it reaches the threshold you have provided. I have seen cases with more than 200 inputs that take weeks to confirm.

Can you register my ASIC in whitelist before zecteam maked any changes for resistance?) I don't want participate in any attacks.. I'm transparent miner, register me in your lists.. thx)

@wertu777 Zcash4mac is depreciated and will not work since the Fork, you will need to transfer your funds to a new wallet like https://github.com/kozyilmaz/zcash-apple

    github.com
    kozyilmaz/zcash-apple
    zcash-apple - Zcash for Apple platform

@alexd88 there is no whitelist for miners, miners are free to mine whatever they choose with whatever pool they choose

@wertu777 To launch the wallet you need to open a command line window and enter

```
java -jar ./zcash/src/ZcashSwingWallet.jar
```



Keep in mind that the wallet .jar file must in the same directory as zcashd.
Of course, replace the above path if you have installed zcashd and the wallet in a different directory.

Are zcash transactions going really slow right now?
I sent some zcash to another wallet i have about a hour ago and still have not received it!

From which wallet to which wallet?

Hello all. I've compiled the code and configured for testnet according to https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide and have 259422 blocks.

    github.com
    zcash/zcash
    zcash - Zcash - Internet Money

I've set up t* and z* addresses then went to get shielded (z) coins from https://faucet.testnet.z.cash/

    faucet.testnet.z.cash
    Zcash Faucet

But I don't see that I've received them. üòû
I'm guessing that the zcashd config is OK since there's so few blocks. But I might be messing something up with my zcash-cli calls.
Any ideas?

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:05 PM
@roger9575-1 The wallet you downloaded is a CLI (command line interface). It is not directly executable and there is no UI.
After you launch zcashd you can run zcash4mac and it should work.
(hopefully!)
But feel free to tip/pay @radix42 as he is the developer of zcash4mac and is in need of funds to keep supporting it üôÇ

Sorry to hear that @roger9575-1 the new version for mac is not as user friendly as zcash4mac
@dimitris.apostolou perhaps they could run WinZEC instead (with the GUI) and move thier old wallet.dat from zcash4mac

@skyl I remember that someone was talking about low hashpower on the testnet and that may have made an accidental Fork for the few people that were running it. @jasondavies or @garethtdavies may know more
jasondavies 4:30 AM
@skyl @mineZcash There was an intentional fork: versions 1.1.0 are on a different chain to versions 1.1.1. Looks like the hashrate on 1.1.0 is pretty low. The explorer and faucet are both on 1.1.0 at the moment.
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:48 AM
That explains why some users are unable to tap the faucet, they are probably running 1.1.1. @SRC

If you do nothing your coins will be safe. However if you want to transact on the Overwinter chain you will have to update.

In nano ledger s ...sensing failed error so i bought another nano ledger new firmware new walet the balance is zero.. why was it not showing my coins.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 7:22 AM
Ledger has not upgraded the firmware to support Overwinter yet.
So you need to wait for now. Your coins are safe but you will not be able to perform any transaction until they release an upgrade.
gojomo 7:29 AM
in such situations, if balance access was urgent, one could potentially enter your ledger many-word wallet-backup-seed into an alternate wallet that is Overwinter-upgraded, if it uses the same derivation-path, and spend the coins that way. (I'm unsure which alt wallets use a ledger-compatible derivation and are Overwinter-ready; maybe Coinomi or Jaxx?)

@jean.paul.calderone are you on the latest version 1.1.1, Linux?

Yes
I had 1.0.13 until a couple days ago. Started it up after not running it for a long time, realized I needed to update, updated to 1.1.1 (debian jessie package), re-started, the node started syncing, I went to bed, and found it in this state this morning.
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:27 AM
Hm, perhaps restarting will `-reindex` would clear the error. That will re-download the chain however. Do you have `gen=1` in your configuration file?
Have you been mining with the CPU miner in Zcashd before?
Normally it says mining is paused while it's syncing
jean.paul.calderone 8:32 AM
I guess I wrote this configuration file a long time ago and then forgot about it ... `genproclimit=0` I don't remember but I guess that means "don't mine"?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:34 AM
Genproclimit is # of threads

jean.paul.calderone 8:36 AM
I guess I turned it off because this is just some random laptop and will presumably never actually mine anything successfully. But then the message about mining being disabled made me think something was broken instead of just being configured that way.

That explains why some users are unable to tap the faucet, they are probably running 1.1.1. @SRC
garethtdavies 10:55 PM
That's the latest version @skyl but there are two versions of the testnet as on v1.1.1 Sapling has activated whereas the faucet is on the Overwinter testnet chain.
skyl 10:56 PM
I appear to have 0.01% of the hashpower on the 1.1.1 testnet ... I wonder if that means I will mine a block with the CPU ... what would happen then I wonder ...
garethtdavies 10:58 PM
I've never had issues mining blocks with a CPU on the testnet, so unless someone has pointed some extra hashpower at it, I don't think you'll have too much trouble.
skyl 11:00 PM
How will I know if I mine a block? üòÉ

If you are not running in daemon mode it will simply tell you otherwise simply run `zcash-cli z_gettotalbalance`

@mineZcash Just a case of editing the conf file as per normal zcashd which is found in `C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Zcash\zcash.conf`. The confusing part is this will be on the Overwinter testnet whereas current clients will be on the Sapling testnet. We need a 1.1.1 Windows binary to solve that issue.

@Haakan unfortunately I don't have any idea when Jaxx will be back online, if you need access to your funds exporting the keys to the Official Linux client or a port like WinZEC will be a good option.

A couple days ago, after official Jaxx email response, I was wondering why if for ZEC devs didn't take much to switch into the overwinter fork , the wallet had such a hard time doing it

So now I realize they'll be doing the work of months in a week possibly?

gojomo 10:42 AM
@Haakan With backup phrases, there are some standards from the Bitcoin world most wallets, especially more-recent and multicurrency-wallets, use in sync with each other. But, there's still some variation in exactly how they use the standard ‚Äì which standard version they default to, which "derivation path" to keep different currencies separate, etc. (For example, IIRC I once verified that, at least for Bitcoin, Ledger phrases were compatible with some other light wallet, but the older BreadWallet used a different "derivation path" for its change addresses, etc.) For more of an idea of how everything can vary, see this web tool ‚Äì https://iancoleman.io/bip39/ ‚Äì and all the options it supports for generating a stream of keys from the seed phrase. (I've used older versions of that page successfully but of course cannot guarantee its trustworthiness.)

Or at least for a firmware upgrade.

Does anyone know if OpenBazaar is Overwinter compatible? (I asked on their slack, still waiting for an answer there.)
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:40 AM
@jean.paul.calderone if you download an Overwinter compatible Zcashd binary to start (like WinZEC) the your OpenBazaar store will be compatible since it runs that binary in the background
jean.paul.calderone 6:42 AM
Okay. That's basically what I tried (but on Linux w/ "official" Zcashd). I wasn't able to get OpenBazaar to talk to Zcashd though (not sure why, debug log doesn't say much more than "The server cannot be reached"), wondered if overwinter might be the cause.
(Asked about that stuff on OpenBazaar slack, too, also waiting for a response...)
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:43 AM
Hm, did you try letting the node sync 100% on its own before starting OpenBazaar?
jean.paul.calderone 6:44 AM
yea
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:46 AM
So the node only shows the error when trying to start it with OpenBazaar but not when running by itself?
jean.paul.calderone 6:46 AM
Zcashd itself seems happy regardless. Only OpenBazaar is sad.
Sorry, the "debug log" I mentioned above is the OpenBazaar debug log, not sure if that was clear.
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:49 AM
I see, then it's an issue with the OB daemon, perhaps there is a firewall issue. I know Windows automatically Blocked it at first when I installed it
Linux may be doing the same
jean.paul.calderone 6:56 AM
Maybe. I think OpenBazaar should be doing a better job logging what's going on. Presumably there's a real error happening somewhere but OB doesn't seem to feel like logging it... makes it hard to track down. üòï
sammy007 7:00 AM
@mineZcash sounds like a reverse logic for me, why not just make correct stratum client?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:06 AM
Because if it is intentional (to have more miners join their own pool) then they may not change it. In which case by giving pools the information they need we can lessen the centralization risks
More options = less centralized (hopefully)
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:18 AM
Which is likely to happen faster; pools adapt to accept more miners? or Bitmain pushes a firmware update to let miners move away from thier pool?

@sammy007 Really? You start by saying you are concerned that it centralizes mining, then say you don't care about decentralization?

If you have an issue with Bitmain software then you should contact them.

Hi - I've some inconsistency between wallet balances using 'listtransactions'(LT) and e.g 'z_gettotalbalance'. If I add all receive(LTR)/send(LTS) transactions and fees of send trasactions (LTF) using the listtransactions rpc I'm getting the following results: SUM(LTR) - SUM(LTS) < z_gettotalbalance but! SUM(LTR) - SUM(LTS) = z_gettotalbalance + LTF/2. So why is SUM(LTR) - SUM(LTS) smaller by the amount off all fees/2 compared to z_gettotalbalance. This doesn't make sense, shouldn't SUM(LTR) - SUM(LTS) > z_gettotalbalance because of the fees.
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:47 AM
Are you seeing _all_ transactions when you run `listtransactions` ? The default is limited to 10. http://chainquery.com/bitcoin-api/listtransactions

I see what's going on now. My wallet contains only a single watchonly address (WA). I assumed listtransaction reports amounts only for WA, but it doesn't. Some of the send-transactions contain inputs which have in addition to WA also additional input-addresses. So that's why I was getting wrong sums.

Zcash remains for ASIC it to be prospectable or not?
I read again and again that it is still possible with ASIC to mines! Is there a safe source?

@Haakan It‚Äôs not sad news. winZEC is currently the most reliable and private way to store your ZEC. It may not have the best UI or support multiple assets but it is the best way to access your ZEC right now.

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:19 AM
I wish every ZEC holder would run a full node. I understand that it‚Äôs impractical for many but it‚Äôs crazy that people are given the privilege to validate transactions by themselves but they prefer to trust someone else to validate their transactions. It‚Äôs like giving away your right to vote and trust someone you don‚Äôt know to cast a vote on your behalf.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:36 AM
Well, I don't run a full node to actually transact with Zcash. I use Trezor's software.
A huge benefit of Sapling is that there won't be a conflict between using hardware wallets (once they support Sapling), shielded addresses, and running a full node

I don't think you will see the transaction from the faucet. Like I said, I think it is on the pre-v1.1.1 fork. If you give me an address I can send some to you.

You would need to downgrade to anything below 1.1.1. Like 1.1.0, for example.
Plus, you would need to run a rescan to get the blocks from the correct chain.

Okay @jasondavies this is my testnet address. Thanks.

Not if you are staying on the current chain it‚Äôll just work when you are sent some. These multiple testnets are confusing.

@joseph.gmt.8 the testnet network hashrate is 27 Sol/s (run `zcash-cli getmininginfo`) so it would likely be possible but pretty pointless to throw a GPU at it - simple CPU mining using the tromp solver will work.

    Upgrade testnet faucet ¬∑ Issue #3364 ¬∑ zcash/zcash
    On faucet.testnet.z.cash it shows the currently running version as 1.0.15. I assume it still works fine since Overwinter activated on testnet via 1.0.15?

sundari 3:00 AM
if i ll downgrade my version it ll be work right??
skyl 3:00 AM
that's what I understand ...
sundari 3:01 AM
ya i also read that
what shall i do now??
skyl 3:01 AM
you can also mine very easily on the testnet
or I can send you some
or you can downgrade and use the faucet
sundari 3:02 AM
ok, first i downgrade version , if it is not ok, ill get from u
how could i mine testnet coin??
one more clariication , if i continue this versiion , can i see my transaction in testfacet??
skyl 3:05 AM

```
testnet=1
addnode=testnet.z.cash
gen=1
equihashsolver=tromp
genproclimit=4

```


in zcash.conf
you can choose a different value for `genproclimit` - 1 will still get you some coins probably ...
you won't see the transaction in the explorer
until the explorer updates
if you run zcashd in the foreground you will see an indication that you found a block
sundari 3:08 AM
if mining coin where it goes,, i mean which address
skyl 3:08 AM
then you have to https://zcash-rpc.github.io/z_shieldcoinbase.html to send it from the taddr where it starts to a zaddr

@joseph.gmt.8 use `z_shieldcoinbase` the docs are here: https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/rtd_docs/payment_api.html#z-shieldcoinbase. The error is pretty self-explanatory coinbase funds must be shielded (sent to a z-addr) before they can be used and you have to send the full amount (that command just makes it easier).

garethtdavies 10:15 PM
Are you sure you are selecting the correct address that you mined to as the `fromaddress`? You can use `z_listunspent` to list your unspent notes and find the address that you mined to (as the amount would be 10 ZEC)
If you have non-mined funds in your wallet you can just use those normally without having to first shield them.

Wow and it seems like any transaction I make from a t-address shows up as confirmed=yes on the GUI but nothing comes up on the block explorer

Yep same thing on there. Checked address and txid. I‚Äôm 99.9% sure it‚Äôs the GUI because the balance of my t-address is also seemingly unchanged after the transaction. And if z-addresses don‚Äôt work, it makes sense that t-addresses don‚Äôt work either. Hmm
This was working fine just a few days ago

To configure with zcashd do we use testnet.z.cash or beta.z.cash?

quantum 8:17 AM
Got it, noticed that.. should have been clearer.. how do I get the same information from zcash-cli?? Also how do I configure zcashd to sync with the betatestnet ( what should go into the addnode)? If I can get this information by RTFM could you point me to the M?
quantum 8:23 AM
Also is there a beta faucet?
I just want to add watch only addresses and test the wallet notify, alert notify etc..
naimed 8:24 AM
if you run the v1.1.1 it should find peers but you could add that explorer.beta.testnet as a node. If you run `zcash-cli getinfo` your zcash node will report those numbers
you can also do `zcash-cli --version` to get your cli and daemon version
quantum 8:25 AM
ah ok, was trying zcash-cli getblockchaininfo..
naimed 8:25 AM
there is not a beta faucet, there are a few folks in #zcash-dev that could send you funds but let me see if I can spin up faucet for v1.1.1, been meaning to for a while

ah yes, I keep forgetting both the explorer and the node API can be on the same URL.. üòë

will.zhang 10:17 AM
Yes, I have checked. The valid share is around 50 and invalid share is rarely observed. I suspect if the network performance can impact(due to high latency), but no invalid shares proves it should not be due to the network. I have no more ideas about this so I finally come here for help.

Did you make sure the daemon that was running from zcash4mac is stopped before running the Swing Wallet? What I mean is, make sure you are not running 2 instances of zcashd at the same time.
zhanna 10:22 AM
yes it's closed
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:23 AM
ok, try something different (less convenient):

1. Download https://github.com/kozyilmaz/zcash-apple/releases/download/v1.1.2a/zcash-macos-v1.1.2a.tar.bz2
2. Expand the archive.
3. Just open Terminal, then drag&drop zcashd in the Terminal window and press enter. Now zcashd is running.
4. Launch zcash4mac or the Swing Wallet.

It looks like what I mentioned earlier. You have another instance of zcashd running.
Launch Activity Monitor, search for zcashd and force quit all instances.

// Read the user authentication section to get your API access token
const BitGo = new BitGoJS.BitGo({ env: ENVIRONMENT, accessToken: ACCESS_TOKEN });

Promise.coroutine(function *() {
// Create Wallet
const wallet = yield BitGo.coin(COIN).wallets().generateWallet({ label: 'Test Wallet - ' + new Date().getTime(), passphrase: PASSPHRASE });

@getsnarky There are many options like https://www.coinpayments.net but, as far as I know, only support transparent addresses. The only way I have seen shielded addresses being accepted in various websites is by simply displaying the address and/or QR code and manually receive the payment to their full node. Of course, I expect this to change after Sapling and hopefully it will become easier for payment processors to integrate shielded addresses.

hi
how are you
what makes zcash a better "private bank in your pocket " than monero ? a lot of fud from monero community?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:51 AM
@fredflintstone It is absolutely logical that people who have invested money into something to consider it better than everything else.

Zcash and Monero are two different approaches to privacy. We should all hope that both succeed, for the sake of human kind. This is not a "last man standing" game. The more privacy options we have, the better for us.

The main two negative arguments that I hear concern the trusted setup and optional privacy.

Both are being worked on.

Along with the upcoming Sapling upgrade, comes also a new trusted setup, but this time it currently includes 85 people (and still growing). You and anyone else can be a part of it, if you wish. The setup is secure as long as just one of the participants is honest. And for a bad actor to hack it and produce ZEC out of thin air, would require to hack all 85 participants. So, while this is a trusted setup, it is virtually impossible to hack it. Having said that, Zcash is exploring other options for future upgrades that do not require a trusted setup.

The idea behind optional privacy was for 2 reasons. One, was to have an easier on-ramp for newcomers, and two, it is currently impossible to use shielded addresses on mobile devices because the computation of those require lots of RAM and CPU power, which makes the use of them practicaly infeasible on a phone.

The upcoming Sapling upgrade in October will make it possible to use shielded address on mobile devices, helping with mass adoption. Then, a deprecation plan for transparent addresses will be put in place.

So, while they are both valid concerns, especially for those outside the Zcash community who are not properly informed, they are actively being dealt with.

What nobody from the Monero community can argue with is that Zcash has the strongest privacy available today. Monero obfuscates the transactions by splitting and mixing them through some transactions that happen to occur at the same time as yours. Zcash obfuscates the transactions by splitting and mixing them through all the transactions that ever occured in Zcash's history.

I would advise everybody to do some research and draw their own conclusions.

mineZcash Admin Owner 5:04 AM
@dstarcev it depends on what happened, if it's just a wallet issue you can probably recover your funds, but if you have sent funds somewhere they're not recoverable. Need more details to help.

I know that I should ask about this trezor support but I asking them and they do not know how help me. Maybe someone also using trezor wallet and have you some idea how can I fix that problem? I had on device zcash coins and very important for me is get back it. Many thank's for your help and I will be really gratefull about any ideas in my case. (sorry for my english)

@22kml I don't know of any way you recover your seed for a hardware wallet. I would try different variations of the words you have written down, maybe one is misspelled or missing an "s" ( car instead of cars ) . But other than trial and error there is no way to "hack" your seed.

hello
admin, why did you decide to use rocket.chat software?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:53 AM
@jovana : Zcash (or, when it's necessary to distinguish from testnet, "the Zcash production block chain")
@321crypto3 : I wasn't responsible for that decision, but it's a fairly obvious choice given that we were previously on Slack (which did not support the number of users needed at a reasonable cost), and Rocket Chat is essentially an open-source clone of Slack

@daira do you personally like it?

Hello I have a Problem
I joined an Zec airdrop ans send some ETH to get Zec Back.
I get 0.9 Zec to my ETH adress But I cannot send them to an exchange Like binance or bittrex to Change or sell IT
Can anybody Help me ?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:50 PM
@mustafa.cetinkaya you cannot receive Zcash at an Ethereum address, they are two separate coins
There are no legitimate ZEC airdrops, I'm afraid your Ethereum is likely lost.

was there ever free zcash for signing up?
mustafa.cetinkaya 1:54 PM

mineZcash Admin Owner 1:55 PM
@raf no, there is no free Zcash for signing up that I know of.
@mustafa.cetinkaya if you have the Zcash address where the funds are then you can check the balance on the Zcash Blockchain: https://explorer.zcha.in

    explorer.zcha.in
    Zchain - Zcash Block Explorer & API
    Zchain: Zcash Block Explorer, Analytics Platform & API. Browse and search blocks, transactions, accounts, statistics and more.

raf 1:58 PM
did zcash ever have it's own trading platform? i swear back in 2016 there was a promotion to sign up for coins
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:59 PM
Zcash was launched on October 28, 2016, not a single coin was in existence until it was successfully mined on that day.
raf 2:00 PM
i'm probably thinking of the wrong coin then
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:00 PM
To get coins on that day you would have to have mined it or bought it from an exchange (or have been sent some from someone)
Just like today

brad Electric Coin Company 3:05 PM

@alexd88 check the user docs to make sure your command line is correct: https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/rtd_docs/user_guide.html (I'm not sure the Sprout guide is accurate anymore)

@alexd88 if it returns `nothing to do` for fetch-params that means you already have the latest installed so there is nothing to update, you can continue with the rest of the install like normal
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 8:49 AM
@frankc01 yes, you should be able to use sapling-crypto (and possibly librustzcash, depending on exactly what you want to do) for that

@dimitris.apostolou Yes, I found that.. I guess I need to build that to a library somehow (again, not a rust familiar person)
or is all that in librustzcash.a?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:45 AM
sapling-crypto can be built using `cargo`, the standard Rust package manager
if you want to interface with C, C++ or another language with a C foreign function interface, then use librustzcash
frankc01 9:46 AM
As we will, thank you.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:47 AM
librustzcash also builds with `cargo`
frankc01 9:49 AM
Yes, I see that is built in the zcash built automatically. As for what we are attempting: We are attempting to adopt the protocol in a private supply chain blockchain and want to enable shielded transaction including all the viewing/spending keys and commitments

garethtdavies 9:23 AM
@jhondoe what version of zcashd are you running? Are you on mainnet or testnet? It's likely a firewall issue (port 8233 for mainnet and 18233 for testnet).

Hi, Sorry, maybe the dumb question, Is it possible to specify the change address, or set the default change address for zcashd?
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:28 PM
@xinming yes and no, in Zcash the behavior for transparent addresses is the as Bitcoin https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change where the change will be sent to one of the 100 addresses you have in your keypool.

    en.bitcoin.it
    Change - Bitcoin Wiki

xinming 12:28 PM
What I mean is, the default one, not the one of 100 addresses randomly. üôÇ
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:29 PM
But if you send from a Z (private addresses) then the change is sent back to the original address.
xinming 12:29 PM
I read that, and bitcoin has a config option which is changeaddress=<your-changeaddress-in-wallet>
I know that, But for now, I need the transparent address.
as I'm going to do a web wallet service
someone told me I'll have to use z_sendmany, and calculate the remain change myself, and send remain coins to the address I want.
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:33 PM
That is how many users get around the issue, like exchanges who have to sweep the change from many transactions into one.
xinming 12:35 PM
Ok, Thanks, I'll go with that.
Another question, not directly related to zcash, but I think they are the same.
xinming 12:36 PM
File Uploaded: Clipboard - August 8, 2018 2:36 AM
I mean, the block format are the same.
In this example, why will a transaction contains both "send" and "recevie" for the same amount, and same address?
Why do we have this in transaction?
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:40 PM
Hm, I'm not sure on that one, perhaps @daira or @bitcartel would know better

I sign it use my code, just sendrawtransaction via rpc
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:31 AM
Have a look at https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/qa/rpc-tests/signrawtransactions.py

    github.com
    zcash/zcash
    zcash - Zcash - Internet Money

I'm not 100% sure it's supported, a dev would know better
Actually offline signing may not be possible yet : https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2542

offline signing not possible?
Need use signrawtransaction rpc?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:38 AM
I'm not sure, a developer like @str4d would know
I haven't used rawtransaction
songfantasy 9:39 AM
@str4d hi
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:40 AM
This is a different known issue
If the offline node isn't synced, it will try to sign with an old signature algorithm, which will fail to validate.
Current workaround is to copy over a block database from an online node.
songfantasy 9:42 AM
I just use my generate private key and t-address sign the raw transaction
Just invoke sendrawtransation rpc send
bitcoin dash work well
zcash not possible?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:45 AM
It's different for Zcash, see the comment above
str4d August 16, 2018 9:41 AM
Current workaround is to copy over a block database from an online node.
Node should be online, and if not online try that
songfantasy 9:47 AM
I not understand whats mean? copy the blockdatabase to online
i sync a zcashd on my server and run the code on it
@str4d plz explain Current workaround is to copy over a block database from an online node.

thanks
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:50 AM
Thanks for answering str4d, I know you guys are busy
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:55 AM
Hmm, if the node is already online, then make sure it's synced up to date

Yes, synced the latest block

Hi @songfantasy read through these common issues https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/rtd_docs/nu_dev_guide.html#common-issues

    zcash.readthedocs.io
    Network Upgrade Developer Guide ‚Äî Zcash Documentation 1.1.2 documentation

songfantasy 10:25 AM
already read...
brad Electric Coin Company 10:26 AM
It looks like the issue isn't that you're signing offline, so perhaps the amount is incorrect?
So, just to be clear on what you're doing, you're using the zcashd node to `createrawtransaction` -> `signrawtransaction` -> `sendrawtransaction` all from the same online node?
songfantasy 10:28 AM
I'm checking the amount..
I not use zcashd node create sign raw transactions, only use sendrawtransaction
brad Electric Coin Company 10:31 AM
So you're creating the transaction with your own code?
songfantasy 10:31 AM
yes
use ./zcash-cli decoderawtransaction xx
decode ok
brad Electric Coin Company 10:33 AM
hmm. I think I'd still go back to making sure the amount(s) you have in the transaction during your signing phase are correct and completely consume the UTXOs. Besides the offline signing issue, I think incorrect amounts are the only time we've seen this error
songfantasy 10:35 AM
If i signed corret, sendrawtransaction should work?
brad Electric Coin Company 10:36 AM
Yes, that's what I'm guessing here
https://zcash-rpc.github.io/signrawtransaction.html

    zcash-rpc.github.io
    signrawtransaction - Zcash 1.1.1 RPC Docs
    Zcash 1.1.1 RPC Docs - signrawtransaction

notice the second argument `prevtxs`. This argument is optional if you're running everything from the same node, but since you're signing this in your own code I think you should use this argument and be sure that the `amount` field for each txid is absolutely correct
songfantasy 10:38 AM
OK, checking, i'm using the signed code https://github.com/iqoption/zecutil

    github.com
    iqoption/zecutil
    zecutil - Zcash golang signer

brad Electric Coin Company 10:39 AM
Before our overwinter upgrade, `amount` was optional, I would guess that signing code doesn't take the change into account
last commits were 4 months ago
songfantasy 10:39 AM
`prevtxs` if i used own code, need this?

yes

Hello, one question, in Zcash v1 (not sapling ) if i lose a wallet transactions list ( between my own z-addresses), but not the private keys, can i still recover my ZEC ? is the note commitment creation deterministic ? do you need to be able to re-calculate the commitment to recover notes ?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:30 AM
@whereiswaldo remember that in Zcash like Bitcoin coins are on the Blockchain (not in your wallet) so if the wallet becomes corrupted you can still recover your Zcash with your private keys.
You would just need to import those keys to a new wallet that supports z-addresses
garethtdavies 8:38 AM
@t0dd The Linux binary is actually available via https://z.cash/downloads/zcash-2.0.0-linux64.tar.gz (the site hasn't been updated yet). As per the docs you can verify the checksum via `sha256sum zcash-2.0.0-linux64.tar.gz` which should return `0597b7d5b6c4e4aa4a1981d7e5870e2e83f7b75622937ed61529b0a459255066` which you can check against the published Gitian signatures here: https://github.com/zcash/gitian.sigs/tree/master/v2.0.0

@szymek9876 that error is pretty informative. WinZEC will place those 3 files (and some others) into `C:\Program Files\winzec\app` by default so check there to see everything installed correctly. Did you use WinZEC previously or a different installer?

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:27 PM
@szymek9876 If you previously made a copy of your wallet.dat file, you can just replace the current one. So, for example, if your backed up wallet.dat had various addresses with funds and your current wallet.dat is empty, then replacing it will make all your funds and addresses reappear. I suggest that you wait until the blockchain is 100% synced and if you are not seeing what you were supposed to be seeing (as before the crash) then you can replace the wallet.dat with your previous one.

@zooko In the stable term, I agree that less options are better for the user. However, the strategy might look different in transition. Allowing people to see it in both ZEC and ZED (maybe defaulting to ZED if we feel very strongly) would allow room for adjustment. I do not think that switching to ZED is a good option, although I do strongly believe we need more units than just ZEC. @zooko @JoshS

Using a small amount to quote Zcash is a topic proposed again and again, for good reason. An analogy for the situation is if you had to always run around with only $100 bills, and you needed to ask for change every time you needed to use it, and express things as "1/5 of $100" rather than "$20." ZED, as a smaller amount, is easier to remember, say, and enter--given assumptions about the amounts that people tend to interact with.

I think that this assumption is tricky, and should be validated. For instance, if we assumed people used Zcash wallets like venmo to pay back for dinner and small purchases, ZED as a unit makes sense. If most of our users used it as a store of value, a balance in ZED might be too much accuracy (i.e. if your balance in the bank showed fractions of pennies). If other users used it to send money across borders to family, then ZEC might be a good match (3 ZEC ~$500) as a unit.

However, cryptocurrency prices fluctuate over time. If ZEC was $1,000,000/coin, ZED is fine (~1USD, easy to understand). If ZEC was $1/coin, ZEC would be fine (~1USD, easy to understand). What we want is a framework that allows for people to express different magnitudes of value. Just like how dollars have thousands, millions, billions, etc. I think we should have words for thousandth of a ZEC, millionth of a ZEC, and billionth of a ZEC (for starters). What people use as their "default" unit (ZEC, ZED, or other values) will be organic, up to them, the use case, and price of ZEC. I think catchy, easy to remember names will help here!

In the protocol, the ephemeral public key epk and the transmission key pkenc are mentioned. Can anyone tell me who generated both of them and how epk and pkenc are generated? What is the specific algorithm?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:47 AM
@fan `e_pk` is generated by the sender, and `pk_enc` is part of the Sprout shielded address of the recipient. They are both the public key of an ECDH keypair, specifically Curve25519 for the Sprout protocol.
For Sapling, the equivalent public keys `e_pk` and `pk_d` are Jubjub curve points.

@str4d Thank you for your answer. I have already read the paper Curve25519. The algorithm introduced in it is not very detailed, so I am a bit confused.
There is another problem. In zcash, the definition of the note commitment tree and the nullifier set are defined. Are these two state sets updated by the miners?

For Sprout, In the paper curve25519, e_pk and pk_enc are generated by curve25519, and in zcash, e_pk needs to be transmitted by the sender to the receiver, used to generat shared secrets, but the zcash protocol did not mention that whether pk_enc need to be sent by the receiver to the sender, how does the sender obtain the information of pk_enc?

@fan In the Zerocash paper (p. üòé they write:

    > Each user now has a key pair (addrpk, addrsk), where addr_pk = (a_pk, pk_enc) and addr_sk = (a_sk,sk_enc). The values (a_pk, a_sk) are generated as before. In addition, (pk_enc,sk_enc) is a key pair for a key-private encryption scheme [BBDP01].

And I just confirmed this is still how it's done in Sprout (not Sapling apparently) in the ZCash spec Version 2018.0-beta-28 (p. 12):

    > [Sprout ] The receiving key skenc , the incoming viewing key i_vk = (a_pk , sk_enc ), and the shielded payment address addr_pk = (a_pk , pk_enc ) are derived from a_sk , as described in ¬ß4.2.1 ‚ÄòSprout Key Components‚Äô on p. 27.

nvesely 12:51 AM
@imiers Thanks. It's just good to have for historical record or something. I guess I wanted to know it existed, despite already being satisfied I'd gotten enough from the IEEE version to understand some of the ideas Zerocash builds on.
fan 1:09 AM
@nvesely The encryption methods used by zerocash and zcash are different. In zerocash paper, asymmetric encryption is used. In zcash protocol uses symmetric encryption, so both the sender and the receiver need to generate shared secrets to obtain the same encryption key K_enc. To do this, both parties need to obtain their own key and the other party's public key. It is currently known that epk will be sent to the receiver, as sender's public key, but what I have not confirmed is: How does the sender get pk_enc to generate the secret value? The zcash protocol does not mention the recipient delivery the information of pk_enc to the sender.
nvesely 1:16 AM
Keep reading in that ZCash protocol section. When a user obtains a "shielded payment address" what they are getting is addr_pk, which includes pk_enc along with a_pk.
nvesely 1:22 AM
I admit I'm really new in this space and didn't know, e.g., that ZCash uses symmetric encryption instead of key-private asymmetric encryption to encrypt the coins. However, just ignoring the larger context of how these values are used, it looks to me that the protocol makes it sufficiently clear how the sender obtains pk_enc. I, at least, cannot provide further clarification or confirmation outside of my interpretation of those passages. @fan

In sprout, (epk, esk) is generated by curve25519, (pk_enc, sk_enc) is generated by key-private encryption scheme, then (epk, esk) and (pk_enc, sk_enc) are used to generate the shared secrets by curve25519, and finally, sender encrypts the plaintext using a symmetric encryption scheme. Right?

Hey, so in the latest version of the ZCash spec, subsubsection "5.4.4.2 Sprout Key Derivation," it says `i - 1` should be the 9th byte of the `kdftag`. However, in the master of the ZCash source (see NoteEncryption.cpp), they just use `i`/`nonce` and don't subtract 1.
So is this a documentation bug, an implementation error, or am I missing something?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:08 PM
@nvesely check whether it's zero-indexed or one-indexed.
nvesely 5:16 PM
Sure, I should say 8th (0th just sounds weird, but 8th is probably more clear/ correct here). That isn't the important part though. It's the fact there seems to be a discrepancy between subtracting one from the nonce and not subtracting one before sticking it into `kdftag`.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:45 PM
@nvesely that's not what I meant by zero- vs one-indexed
nvesely 5:46 PM
I wasn't sure what you meant. I just took my best guess.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:46 PM
If you follow the link to Section 4.1.5, you'll see that KDFSprout\text{KDF}^\text{Sprout}KDFSprout takes as input an index `i` in the range {1..Nnew}\{1..\text{N}^\text{new}\}{1..Nnew}, i.e. one-indexed (because `{a..b}` is defined in Section 2 as the set of integers from `a` to `b` inclusive).
Whereas in the code, we use zero-indexed indices, i.e. in the range {0..Nnew‚àí1}\{0..\text{N}^\text{new}-1\}{0..Nnew‚àí1}
Thus to make things match up, the instantiation of KDFSprout(i,...)\text{KDF}^\text{Sprout}(i, ...)KDFSprout(i,...) in the protocol spec uses `i - 1` in the tag.
nvesely 5:53 PM

In sprout, (epk, esk) is generated by curve25519, (pk_enc, sk_enc) is generated by key-private encryption scheme, then (epk, esk) and (pk_enc, sk_enc) are used to generate the shared secrets by curve25519, finally, sender encrypts the plaintext using a symmetric encryption scheme. Right?

Is it convenient to provide the source code for the mine pool that can be run normally after zcash 2.0?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:43 AM
@fan the sender can add a note in the memo field if they want to give additional information to the recipient. Or they could send you a viewing key to see the transaction on the chain. Otherwise if they send a private (z-z) transaction there is no way for the recipient to know who the sender was.
@jerry-1 I don't know of open source pool software that has been updated to support 2.0.

@str4d ,Another question, I can't always understand how the memo field and so on are encrypted in zcash(sprout)? Symmetric encryption or key-private asymmetric encryption? @daira said that Zcash does use key-private asymmetric encryption. It uses symmetric encryption to construct a hybrid asymmetric scheme in exactly the same way Zerocash does; it's just a slightly different hybrid construction. But the encryption process in the zcash protocol does use a symmetric encryption key, and it seems to use a symmetric encryption scheme.

arielg 6:56 AM
@fan the 'Agree' part is where it's sort of asymmetric: `sharedSecret` can be computed from the sender (ephemeral) private ky and recipient public key or the sender ephemeral public key `epk` together with the recipient private key
fan 7:02 AM
@arielg What is key-private asymmetric encryption used for? Just generate the

```
transmission key and receiving key
```

?
arielg 7:04 AM
Basically yeah.. and the ephemeral (one time) keys of sender `esk` and `epk`
Again, these keys are not used directly for encryption/decryption, just used to generate the symmetric key `K_i` in image

sammy007 4:22 AM
yeah would be nice to use here only for necessary announcements
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 4:23 AM
In any case, I'd like to answer @fan's question
1. The owner of a note is the holder of the spending key. This is not a statement about identity; in most cryptographic protocols we only authorise operations by requiring knowledge of keys, and it's quite possible (and desirable, sometimes) to delegate use of keys.
The JoinSplit statement proves for each input coin that the a_sk known by the prover corresponds to an a_pk committed to by the note commitment
2. KA and SYM are used together to define a key-private asymmetric encryption scheme, similar to ECIES. See 8.7 of the spec for motivation of this scheme

Hey, thanks for the answers -- I think I already saw those repos before, but didn't quite get how I am supposed to install the whole stack with those. I thought the presence of package,json would indicate that I should run a 'npm install', but the guide states I should grab 'bitcore-node@latest' first. Which of these is correct? And do I need to grab a zcashd binary first in order to make this work? (all I need at the moment is just grabbing data from mainnet through Insight, no need for a wallet)

If your funds are in transparent addresses, you can try using another wallet for the time being. If your funds are in shielded addresses, you have to either wait for an updated build or install the Linux build on a VM.

I think the powers of tau was the starting point for the second phase, so the final sapling parameters are dependant on them, but I don't know if they could be extracted
here the final parameters are shared via a torrent file which currently has 0 seeds.
ice.1 7:45 AM
I see, I think the first phase was ran by @ebfull , so maybe the seeds are down but the file is still available. Or @jasondavies may have it?

Does anyone know if WinZEC v1.1.2 (latest) is compatible with upcoming Sapling network upgrade?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:54 AM
@thethirstywalrus Sapling requires v2.0.0+
thethirstywalrus 7:54 AM
ok, I'd have to find out what daemon version is running underneat WinZEC v1.1.2...it's not in step with the zcash daemon release versioning
when Sapling goes live, what is the anticipated impact for clients that have not been upgraded to latest zcash daemons?

...but my inAddr is t1aKixoSWeyaFhr7sk3o9ZyihczhCdmQKiA...
The rest seems to fit (aside from number of confirmations)
addrIns for other transactions seem messed up as well, I guess something went wrong with the fork... How are the plans for introducing the bitcore API for 2.0?

@dahliaday You don't need Ubuntu to run a Zcash node on macOS. It runs natively.

I have set one up myself for the zcashcommunity shop, but it's not up now because I don't have the time to add all the products

@sushil Welcome. I saw you are asking for help. What is the problem?
sushil 3:42 AM
yes actully i want integrate zcash node sdk
actually
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:19 AM
There's no SDK as such; a zcashd full node has an RPC interface (like in Bitcoin), and there are various libraries for accessing it or for processing/creating transactions
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:25 AM
The RPC interface is based on Bitcoin's RPC API which is documented at https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#remote-procedure-calls-rpcs . Our changes are documented at https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/payment_api.html

(When using APIs inherited from Bitcoin, check the RPC help to see any Zcash-specific changes, which can be done by running a full node and using `zcash-cli help <commandname>`.)

Interesting, is Crumbs like Robinhood where you can "invest" in Zcash but not actually withdraw Zcash? @imjosh
imjosh 8:32 AM
Yes, that's true. We're going to add a feature to withdraw off app eventually. The target audience is the general populace so our first priority is making everything as simple as possible for the lay user right now
Until then when users sell the Zcash the buy it will go to an FDIC-insured cash wallet on the app. After which point they can cash out to bank or buy again, etc
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:10 AM
I've been curious how these kinds of apps work, is there any actual custody of the Zcash? or is it more like buying in an index, and returns are based on the what the market rate is? I assume it's structured this way to avoid regulatory concerns.

In order to use zcash on openbazaar you need to enter the path to the zcash binary in the wallet setup. How does one do this?

@dahliaday You just need to browse to the directory where `zcashd` is installed. The path is different, depending on your platform and the type of installation you performed. On macOS, for example, the standard path is `/Users/*user*/zcash/src/zcashd`

I don't know when the Developers will have the new release ready for public release, but you could pull the v2.0.1-rc1 release candidate to continue use of testnet until they do. But keep in mind the Testnet block explorer will not be compatible until it's updated after the release.
Or since it seems like you are in a rush @neeraj , easiest thing would be to spend a few dollars or BTC and buy some Zcash for your testing.
garethtdavies 10:06 AM
@neeraj @neeraj you'll need to be running v2.0.1-rc1 to use the testnet but if you are just add your address here and I'll send you some testnet coins. And actually https://faucet.testnet.z.cash/ has been updated so will work.

    z.cash
    How It Works | Zcash
    Zcash is a digital currency with powerful privacy features. It is built on highly scrutinized science and is managed via blockchain, so it is attack- and censorship-resistant. At the core of the protocol are zero-knowledge proofs ‚Äî zK-SNARKs ‚Äî which allow a transaction to be verified without revealing sender, receiver or transaction amount.

The mystery. I have WinZec wallet of the latest version 1.1.2.
2018-09-19 at 21.42.45 (Moscow time) without my permission the sum 0.4855745 ZEC was withdrawn out.
Money left from my address t1YJL8LsCMsDGGpiKuGW9hASomej7HPdtek to the address t1S2uHVid65wCbXK2z1iuiPEZpuzwqR9eMA, then at once it to the address t1L6tCHAx3HgWAMdqNJUSRpPnsN3JoaryH6 etc.
It is possible to look on https://zcashnetwork.info/address/t1S2uHVid65wCbXK2z1iuiPEZpuzwqR9eMA, txid, bbb9606ec695eb4c0ac5fe6c3cde2ed9794e6aa50294882e7c72197efec1e89b
Only I have access to the computer. There are no viruses, remote desktop connections forbidden, I have not installed program like TeamViewer or Radmin. I use Comodo Internet Security Premium v.10 with latest updates.

On September, 18 I and my wife took off urgently for Yerevan on a funeral of the close relative and back to Moscow September, 23.
The computer was switched-on and mined Z-cash to the address t1YJL8LsCMsDGGpiKuGW9hASomej7HPdtek, the mining passed on FlyPool.
I found loss by 2018-09-26.

Proceeding from told follows:
1. There is no house anybody at 2018-09-19
2. WinZec didn‚Äôt started during out transaction
3. I think miner EWMF v.0.3.4b is not guilty. . It start by one line: ‚Äúminer - server eu1-zcash.flypool.org - port 3333 - user t1YJL8LsCMsDGGpiKuGW9hASomej7HPdtek - pass x‚Äù
4. Loss of private key is excluded. I checked the wallet file for an opportunity to read private keys by the Walletaid-master program (based on Python v.2.7). It‚Äôs impossible - the wallet.dat is fine protected.
5. Proceeding Windows logs ‚Äì not unauthorized activity existed.
6. On my computer about 15 wallets installed. Some of them have many times more sum, however their funds in place. But all wallets encrypted, only WinZec have not this function. On October, 30 I wrote to Ms. Jane MercerWeiss (@radix42). Small later she answered. She noticed the silly commission of the transactions' chain.

Help me to solve this riddle please! Whether there were similar cases with the small sums of Zec?

jean.paul.calderone 7:24 AM
is there a `zcash-cli` command, or some other method, for forgetting about a zaddr or taddr?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:28 AM
@jean.paul.calderone no; one of the invariants that Bitcoin Core has, which Zcash inherited, is that addresses are never deleted. You'd need to create a new wallet and import the keys you want.
Maybe key deletion is feasible, but it's not a functionality we could just throw in (it could end up breaking all sorts of undocumented assumptions in the Bitcoin-inherited code)
jean.paul.calderone 8:47 AM
Okay. Wallet juggling isn't so bad, I guess. Just did what I wanted that way (just cleaning up junk addresses in a test wallet on testnet). Abstractly, seems like dropping zaddrs from a wallet in some safe and rigorous way might be a desirable feature as part of the privacy story.
Thanks
jean.paul.calderone 9:10 AM
Are addresses for imported *viewing* keys meant to be included in `z_listaddresses` result?
(I thought so and I thought I had observed this with 2.0.0 but I'm not seeing any addresses show up while trying to repeat this on 2.0.1-rc1)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:38 AM
@jean.paul.calderone see the help text for that RPC (you need to explicitly specify you want watch-only / viewing addresses)
jean.paul.calderone 9:39 AM
aaah ü•ö thanks
might be clearer to consistently refer to such addresses as "viewing" or "watch-only"
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:52 AM
Yeah... the Bitcoin-inherited RPCs refer to watch-only addresses, which we were being consistent with
And to some extent it makes sense to have watch-only addresses as a separate concept from viewing keys.
jean.paul.calderone 9:58 AM
ah. I don't know about Bitcoin watch-only addresses. Maybe my mental model is missing pieces that would make this make more sense.

@wobbzz Hey, thanks! I think we're looking into it. However, our engineers need to be focused on safely rolling out Sapling and supporting the ecosystem through that transition and doing security monitoring and security preparations so I don't want to distract them from that to hunt for those files. (Also, the files are not necessary to verify that zaddr users's privacy is safe.)

[Moderation edit by @daira: Zooko is mistaken on the latter point: these files *are* needed to verify that the proof system is zero-knowledge which is needed for privacy.]

All is fully sapling compatible with additional UI tweak (such as multi currency and UI change support), comes built in signed packages so no more warning on Windows nor macOS. Releases will be updated periodically and new features will als be added soon. We are also trying to build more products for Zcash which will be available later this year on zecmate.com
You can download and test ZECmate from the official site https://swing.zecmate.com or from github https://github.com/ZECmate/ZECmate-swing-wallet

i have Zcash in my ledger blue wallet
but I'm not able to send any out reads a failure message when trying to send. i have updated my wallet for sapling to the latest zcash wallet on ledger
garethtdavies 7:44 PM
@fredflintstone what's the error? Have you tried Ledger support?
fredflintstone 7:45 PM
they are in france
i tried reaching out to them by email an hour ago
the error is failure to send ...something about API
are you having trouble with a ledger sending Zcash? also my balance in Zcash is correct but my balance in USD is way off and is reading wrong
my total balance of cash on my ledger reads 3 thousand dollars over what the actual cash amount in use should be
don't know whats wrong
garethtdavies 7:48 PM
the exact message would help but given it's about the API it might just be some part of their infrastructure is down
fredflintstone 7:49 PM
ill give you the message . can you hold a sec ?
im gonna try to send again then ill copy the error message so you can see
sending failed. an error occurred please try again later

Yeh that's super generic. Something went wrong... could be basically anything wrong with their API. You'll probably have to wait for a response from Ledger.

@sammy007 negligible memory required for signing; basically same as for transparent transactions.
It's very similar to creating an Ed25519 signature, so anything that can handle those can handle RedJubjub signatures (with appropriate firmware changes).

Mining Equihash using the Zcash parameters is not profitable with GPUs. It is still somewhat profitable if you use ASICs (last time I checked, at least) depending on the capital outlay, but you are typically competing with miners with access to cheap/subsidised electricity.

I dont know. You can do whatever you want. I am not going to be cursed by technical insults.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:23 AM
@highlow There is indeed no way to know. That is why Sapling introduced an audit process in order to migrate from old Sprout z-addresses to the new Sapling z-addresses. Users are not allowed to send from Sprout z-addresses to Sapling z-addresses. They need to send to a transparent address first and then to a Sapling z-address. This way, Zcash can audit all the shielded amounts, and make sure there is no hidden inflation.

Cryptocurrency like Zcash uses a Proof of Work. This proof of work can be performed on slow/low power device _but_ you are competing against _everyone else on earth_ to get the same rewards. It's not the PoW that is the reason it's not profitable to mine with a cellphone, its all the other miners with more powerful hardware that can perform the same problem solving faster.
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:36 PM
For instance, you mentioned that a cellphone gets 100 Sols/s . The average ASIC gets 10,000 Sols/s and the more powerful ones get 50,000 Sols/s. And there are literally _thousands_ of those on the Zcash network. Trying to mine with a cellphone is simply not capable of competing. It's like bringing a bicycle to race against a Supercar.

    There are three different flavors of "Project Alchemy"

@enver I've seen speculation on twitter (regarding other coins) that Bitumb allows 0 fee trading, so people speculate that there are bots conducting wash trades to pump up the volume on some coins. Not saying with certainty that this is what's happening to ZEC there, but it's a possibility. It's also possible that the Koreans just really love some Zcash üòÑ

The user has taken advantage of a promotional offer by Bithumb which offers 120% payback on all trading fees. According to crypto analyst Alex Kr√ºger, the user is engaging in wash trading which allows him to claim the maximum payback amount of $150,000 every day.

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:56 AM
that indicates that the transaction made it to the mempool of Private Internet Access' node
it does not necessarily indicate that it was ever mined
(if it wasn't, then you should still have the funds. however, I'm not certain that your wallet will correctly show the balance in this case, unless it is resync'd)
plaplea 8:02 AM
Ok well so it could technically happen that a transaction actually takes this long ?
Well the Blockchain is 100% synced, Is there a special CLI to resync the wallet?
plaplea 8:30 AM
I did zcashd -resync as you suggested in the forum, money is still not on any of my wallets, so It must be something else
garethtdavies 8:32 AM
Did you use a custom fee? Seems unlikely to me that it would reach the mempool and not be mined within time and more likely an issue with the recipient.
plaplea 8:35 AM
I don't know what the custom fee is

now i tried reindex, well that wasnt the best idea blockchain is now 0% synced ^^

plaplea 9:10 AM
::No, it has to be enabled in advance:: I understand that, what I mean is for future transfers I do, if I start my node with payment disclosure enabled, then I can prove they were sent?

garethtdavies 9:18 AM
Correct. It's a little involved and I have no idea if anything has changed with regards to Sapling but yes that's what it is there for.

It doesn't matter. They are also visible on the public block explorer. You just can't see the sender, receiver and amount sent.
This is an example of a z to z transaction -> https://explorer.zcha.in/transactions/b4b1fd3265d2fe91037af697089a4c718579b24c5faf9fe7b4803735483e5a6e

And also zec-qt-wallet allows you to save outgoing shielded txs locally so even though it isn't "proof" in the same way you'll get a txid and see where you sent it which solves most problems: https://github.com/adityapk00/zec-qt-wallet

And, by the way, it's worth checking your debug.log file around the time of the transaction. It's all printed there. Even potential errors.

garethtdavies 10:08 AM
yeh and also what about `z_getoperationresult` is there a txid in there? though if you restarted zcashd this information is gone.
plaplea 10:20 AM
Im trying to get the QT wallet working right now
Because otherwise I have to wait until tomorrow before I do anything
It keeps telling me Can't find zcashd at "/home/user/zec-qt-wallet/zcashd" ¬∞-¬∞
I suppose it cant find it because its not there lol üòÉ
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:26 AM
Which platform are you on?
plaplea 10:26 AM
debian
stretch
the binarys didnt work for me so i had to compile manually, worked fine and when i start it will download the params but after it crashes because it looks for zcashd which is not where it wants it to be üòÆ
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:27 AM
Hm, it should run as a standalone app.
adityapk00 10:28 AM
Let me look into why debian stretch is not working.
Are you running zcashd in a separate window?
plaplea 10:29 AM
"/zec-qt-wallet: /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.25' not found (required by ./zec-qt-wallet)"
I get this from the binarys
adityapk00 10:29 AM
Oh, I know what's going on- It can't find libc.
plaplea 10:29 AM
Yeah üòÉ
I know that üòÉ but I wouldnt know how to downgrade
adityapk00 10:30 AM
OK, you have 2 options:
1. You can download a release from here: https://github.com/adityapk00/zec-qt-wallet/issues/31#issuecomment-436795404

    github.com
    Can't run on Ubuntu: cannot open shared object file ¬∑ Issue #31 ¬∑ adityapk00/zec-qt-wallet
    On running the binary on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS I get: ./zec-qt-wallet: error while loading shared libraries: libpng16.so.16: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

That can work on older debian versions.
2. You can run zcashd in a separate window, then your compiled zec-qt-wallet should connect to it automatically.
plaplea 10:31 AM
Im trying to use the embedded zcashd
adityapk00 10:31 AM
If you are compiling zec-qt-wallet, you also need to compile zcashd to use the embedded zcashd.
But it will work just fine with an external zcashd as well
Maybe I should clarify that in the README. I'll update it.
plaplea 10:33 AM
"If you don't have one, zec-qt-wallet will start its embedded zcashd node." How to compile the embedded zcashd node
adityapk00 10:34 AM
Compiling zcashd is an involved process, but here are the instructions: https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/user_guide.html#installation

    zcash.readthedocs.io
    User Guide ‚Äî Zcash Documentation 2.0.1 documentation

plaplea 10:35 AM
So the binarys include the compiled zcashd but if i compile manually the zcashd is not included in the repository, did i get that right now ? üòÉ
So now i clone zcashd and compile that manually as well, yes?
With repository I mean the wallets repository
adityapk00 10:36 AM
Yup.
1. clone zcashd and build it
2. clone zec-qt-wallet and build it
3. copy zcashd from step 1 to the zec-qt-wallet directory
garethtdavies 10:37 AM
surely you have zcashd already? why not use that?
adityapk00 10:38 AM
Yeah, just running an existing zcashd is probably much easier
plaplea 10:38 AM
Cause I started it with reindex
So i have to resync it anyway
Well initially I thought the wallet would embed zcashd
garethtdavies 10:38 AM
right, this will use the same chain data regardless as this is shared (assuming same data dir directory)
plaplea 10:39 AM
Now i learned if i compile it manually then it doesnt üòÉ
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:39 AM
Make sure you are not using an old version of zcashd that was perhaps bundled with the swing wallet.
plaplea 10:39 AM
Nono I installed the swing wallet much later
So the zcash I had running mustve been the most current version
garethtdavies 10:40 AM
what version are you currently running?
`zcash-cli --version` or `zcashd --version`
plaplea 10:40 AM
None because i removed zcash because I thought it was inteferring with the embedded one from the wallet haha üë®üë©üëßüë¶
Well Im gonna reinstall it now and just have the external zcash running then to let the wallet connect to it
I just wanted it to configure the conf correctly etc
garethtdavies 10:41 AM
If you are Debian you can also use a package manager to save you building
plaplea 10:42 AM
Yea that way I did it when i first installed it as well

Obviously theres rpcpassword=blasomething below

I believe there was something different in it before as per the user guide
garethtdavies 10:47 AM
yeh, that's fine to get up and running (assuming the rpcpassword line is there too)
plaplea 10:48 AM
Ok now i did zcash-fetch-params
After I will start and then wait till tomorrow ^^ Or is there any way to accelerate the blockchain syncing?
I do have a fast internet connection

plaplea 10:50 AM
Its what i love most üòõ
adityapk00 10:51 AM
Just note that zec-qt-wallet won't be able to show you past outgoing transactions
It only stores transactions sent through zec-qt-wallet, it won't be able to reveal details of transactions that were already sent before (This is because zcashd doesn't store them)

    üëç 1 

plaplea 10:52 AM
Yeah I get that. TBH im quite sure the problem is on the receivers end, im just stuck with a very untalented support agent^^
adityapk00 10:52 AM
üôÇ
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:53 AM
Did you check you debug.log from the time of the transaction? It contains all the info you need.
plaplea 10:53 AM
where is it located
found it
Christ why didnt i check that before
Hmm doesnt contain data before today though
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:57 AM
Perhaps it got deleted when you uninstalled zcashd.
plaplea 10:57 AM
Yea possible that this is due to me doing stuff
I remembered to export my wallets though ^^
It was hard to find the right wallet for the zcash
Should include the two you recommended somewhere people cant miss it
btw. I run debian 4.9.0-8-amd64 thats why the binarys didnt work probably
my glib is 2.2.7
adityapk00 11:05 AM
I will update zec-qt-wallet with a new build that will work with older versions of glibc tomorrow.
plaplea 11:05 AM
Ah ok. glibc is a c library do I understand that correctly?
I do some development too but I dont know much about C/CPP programming..
More Java/Gradle/spring stuff
adityapk00 11:07 AM
Yeah. glibc 2.2 was released in Aug 2000 IIRC, so it's quite old. Libraries like Qt don't support it correctly, and it needs to be built specially.
Right. glibc is the c library that all C/C++ programs link against. It is usually provided by the OS, so apps don't bundle it.
That's why we run into version problems with it, since it is provided by the OS, and if it provides an older version, the app gets confused
plaplea 11:10 AM
Yeah I get it, nothing u need to worry about in Java üòõ
Also qt looks quite cool, ssems to just be a framework which extends c/c++ with additional features, so it it like spring or gradle?
adityapk00 11:10 AM
I know. Java takes care of all this underneath, so it all Just Works‚Ñ¢
qt is a cross-platform UI framework. It's a UI toolkit like Swing or JFC or JavaFX

Just thinking some more unless you happened to spend the exact amount you should see an incoming change tx to the same z addr. That could confirm the transaction was mined or not?

If you have the wallet.dat file, it will restore all your Sapling addresses (even the ones created after you backed up the wallet) but will restore your Sprout addresses only until the point you backed up.
I highly advise that you write down the private key for each one of your addresses. It can be a life saver in disaster scenarios.

Dear Z-cash community. We, a team of enthusiasts, are pleased to inform you about our project https://ztalk.info/ which logs all important telegram chats related to Z-cash. We believe that Z-cash Chats will be a valuable addition to the Z-cash ecosystem. During the work of the site, we have already received a large number of positive feedback from community members. The project is under active development. The project has its own team of programmers, ready at any time to solve new technical problems and make new improvements.

What is implemented at the moment:
You can read your favorite chats in a convenient form for you through https://ztalk.info/ The site is optimized for work also on mobile devices. There is a search by keyword and date. It is possible to read the chat you want in your native language using Google Translate. The translation is not perfect, but it will allow you to receive the latest news as quickly as possible from the first sources. For example, you can use our site to read Russian, Italian and other versions of Z-cash telegram chat.

In the near future, we plan to add the ability to share a specific telegram post in social networks. On the one hand, this will allow you to share interesting content with your friends and subscribers, and on the other hand, it will positively influence the development of Z-cash‚Äôs popularity as a whole.

@nikolas.glushe thank you for contributing this tool, I know that some people do use telegram for Zcash and other cryptocurrency discussion. I don't think you have much control over the telegrams that you link to, but you may just want to have a disclaimer that you are aggregating the data from several sites, not running those sites. That should keep you in the clear with regards to any TM concerns.

Telegram hasn't been as big of a part of the Zcash discussions as some other cryptocurrencies, we have this chat, the forum, and the subreddit which seem to be the most popular. But none the less, if that's what users feel comfortable using they are welcome to do so. They should avoid calling any Telegram group "official" since it is not hosted/moderated by Zcash Company.
nikolas.glushe 6:30 AM
@mineZcash Thank you for the disclaimer advice. In the near future we will use it. If the Zcash has its own official chat rooms in telegrams, we will be happy to add them to our site. Then guests of our site will be able to join official chat rooms in the telegram or read them in their native language from our site.

Does anyone have data on the proportion of shielded funds stored in Sprout and Sapling? Something like this but more detailed: https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/value

garethtdavies 8:42 AM
`zcash-cli getblockchaininfo` will return the amount in each value pool. So currently it looks like this with 336k ZEC in Sprout and 25k ZEC in Sapling

```
"valuePools": [
    {
      "id": "sprout",
      "monitored": true,
      "chainValue": 336817.53899934,
      "chainValueZat": 33681753899934
    },
    {
      "id": "sapling",
      "monitored": true,
      "chainValue": 25220.21097501,
      "chainValueZat": 2522021097501
    }
  ]

```

You'd have to calculate the current supply from the block height (or grab from somewhere else) in order to get the proportion each of those are to the overall issuance.

Any recommended reading to point me in the right direction?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:25 AM
@0xvox I'm not sure it's feasible to create an entire token system with zkSNARKs at this time. I do know that Ethereum has been able to integrate zk proofs into smart contracts but the can be expensive (gas) to compute

mineZcash Admin Owner 10:28 AM
Basically: >The generator is run off-chain to produce the proving key and verification key. Any prover can then use the proving key to create a proof, also off-chain. The general verification algorithm can then be run inside a smart contract, using the proof, the verification key and the public input as input parameters. The outcome of the verification algorithm can then be used to trigger other on-chain activity.

hello, don't know where to write my problem, can anyone tell me how to get zs address? i download winzec and sync, when i try to create private address it creates zc address, i want zs, how can i do it?
garethtdavies 10:09 AM
@gangcho you need to use the command line. So with WinZEC running open a terminal and change directory to `C:\Program Files\winzec\app` then you can run `zcash-cli.exe z_getnewaddress sapling` and it'll generate a new Sapling address and you can use as before with WinZEC.
The good news as of the next release of `zcashd` `z_getnewaddress` will default to giving a Sapling address so I imagine a new WinZEC release will soon follow
There are also other GUIs that work with Sapling addresses right now such as https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/zec-qt-wallet

@Magnum_Wallet Are you supporting shielded addresses?
Magnum_Wallet 4:41 AM
No, it's tough to support it, cause Magnum is web-based. But, our devs found out the way how it could work and forward it to Zcash team to discuss this option

Hey folks.
I have been trying to read up on zcash. I read through https://z.cash/blog/zcash-private-transactions several times.
One question that has been really bothering me but I haven't been able to find the answer to is "We did not go into details on how to eliminate the need for a private channel between sender and recipient." How is this private channel eliminated?

PS. I am not that mathematically gifted to be able to read the protocol specification üòÖ

    z.cash
    How Transactions Between Shielded Addresses Work - Zcash
    In ‚ÄòAnatomy of A Zcash Transaction‚Äô we gave a general overview of Zcash Transactions. The purpose of this post is ‚Ä¶

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:02 AM
@atvanguard instead of requiring every sender and recipient to have their own private channel, senders encrypt the notes they create in their transactions, and then recipients scan the block chain for notes they can decrypt.

    ‚òë 1 

atvanguard 6:06 AM
In the context of the blog post, if a recipients note is stored as `Hash(Pk, r)`, then without the knowledge of `r` how does the recipients know which note belongs to them just with the knowledge of `Pk`. Sorry if the question is naive and I am missing something trivial.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:09 AM
`r` is part of the note, and thus part of what is encrypted by the sender. The recipient trial-decrypts to get a candidate `Note = (Pk, r)`, and then re-computes `Hash(Note)` and compares it to what was in the transaction publicly.
atvanguard 6:15 AM
So does the sender send `(E(Note), Hash(Note))` where `Hash(Note)` goes to the notes database. The recipient tries out decrypting E(Note), obtain `r` and try to match with the hash. Sounds good?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:30 AM
Roughly yes. The "database" that `Hash(Note)` goes into is the note commitment Merkle tree.

    ‚òë 1 

atvanguard 6:50 AM
Thank you @str4d This helps a lot.
A couple more questions.
1. When the sender is generating a zkp to generate a transaction, is `Hash(Note)` a public input as well? I think it is not and instead of that I am guessing the root of the commitment Merkle tree is a public input? (along with nullifier = `Hash(r)` as another public input)

2. Is there a simpler less math intensive yet verbose documentation of zcash that I can read first before eventually preparing myself to read the specification. 141 pages of PhD level maths can be quite overwhelming üòÖ
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:52 AM
yes, the commitment (cm in the actual protocol) is a public input to an Output proof in Sapling, or to a JoinSplit proof in Sprout
there is a "high-level overview" section in the spec itself
gail 7:58 AM
Has joined the channel.
atvanguard 8:00 AM
Thanks Daira.
atvanguard 12:31 PM
I am back with a question üòÖ
for generating the zkp, I need to say "the coin commitment cm (for the coin i am spending) appears as a leaf of a merkle tree with root rt" - where rt is a public input.
Now my question is, `rt` would change after each transaction, so then how a does sender generate a new transaction when they know that even within a block, `rt` is constantly changing and hence their proof would be obsolete very soon?

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:59 PM
@atvanguard `rt` doesn't go out-of-date, it is just associated with a particular block height
Validators just look up the tree corresponding to the root a transaction contains (from a local map of trees for each block).
xavier.johnson 8:11 PM

atvanguard 6:05 AM
@str4d can you elaborate a little. Are you saying there is a merkle tree per block and the spender says something like `(blockNumber, merkleroot for the corresponding block)`
Where the blockNumber is the block where the note was created

Hello - just a question about how Zcash works under the hood. So my understanding is that a hash of tx data is posted to a list. When someone wants to spend that utxo, they prove that they are using an input from that list. That input has to then be removed from the list somehow or marked as spent otherwise the coins could be doublespent. If the hash is marked as spent at the same time that a new hash enters the list (the new output), can't someone infer that those 2 hashes are linked and create a transaction graph?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:43 PM
@quantafire I'm not an expert in the cryptography as some other Developers here. I believe in Zcash the the "list" you are thinking of is referred to as the Sapling (or Sprout) value circuit. The magic of zkSNARKs and Zero knowledge proofs is that the transaction could have come from _any_ of the private transactions that have ever entered the Circuit. The new transaction proves that the transaction is valid but doesn't allow for a transaction timing attack like you are describing.
Again, my knowledge is limited, an expert like @daira or @str4d would know more.
Lots of good reading material on the main site https://z.cash/technology/zksnarks/

garethtdavies 5:55 PM
@quantafire try the protocol spec - the high level overview I think explains this specifically:

```
The basis of the privacy properties of Zcash is that when a note is spent, the spender only proves that some commitment for it had been revealed, without revealing which one. This implies that a spent note cannot be linked to the transaction in which it was created.
```

But the input tx has to be marked as spent somehow though otherwise doublespends could occur right? Even if there isn't a direct link, an observer seeing that a note was marked as spent and a new note being generated at the same time could infer the link
Yeah @mineZcash that's what I was reading that generated my question haha
garethtdavies 6:00 PM
but you don't know which note is spent and it can be literally any of the other shielded txs to have ever happened in Zcash
quantafire 6:00 PM
Then what's to stop someone from double spending the coins?
garethtdavies 6:01 PM
because there is a list of nullifiers

```
The nullifiers are necessary to prevent double-spending: each note on the block chain only has one valid nullifier, and so attempting to spend a note twice would reveal the nullifier twice, which would cause the second transaction to be rejected.
```

again, the high level overview of the spec does explain this well
(copy and pasting does a weird job on that for some strange reason)
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:02 PM
Also keep in mind that there can't be an "Observer" watching the Private transactions to make the correlation because they are not visible on-chain.
quantafire 6:10 PM
@garethtdavies Right, but if you post a nullifier for a utxo at the same time as creating another utxo, can't people see that happening at the same time?
I've been avoiding reading it because it's intimidating lol, I guess I should just suck it up
@mineZcash I meant watching this list, so I guess the value circuit. A list of nullifiers and utxos has to be publicly viewable otherwise people wouldn't be able to check if coins they're receiving are legit right?
garethtdavies 6:13 PM
As I understand, yes that would be correct but it doesn't matter as you can't link anything together such as when that created note is spent so it doesn't provide any useful information. As for the spec the high level overview is very readable, and that's typically about as far as I can get üòÉ

quantafire 6:39 PM
@garethtdavies Thanks, I'll have a listen soon
When you say that an observer doesn't know when a created note is spent... why not? When the nullifier for it is published, don't they know then?
garethtdavies 6:50 PM
They know a note was spent but not which one.
quantafire 8:37 PM
@garethtdavies Ahhhh I think I see - they don't know which note was spent but double-spends can still be verified because the nullifier could be the same as a nullifier that has already been published. I didn't realise the nullifier wasn't linked to the txo. Thanks!
taw33 3:00 AM

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:47 AM
the tricky bit is that a note's commitment and its nullifier can both be linked to the note in zero knowledge (in the output proof and the spend proof respectively), but they can't be linked to each other
how that is done differs between Sprout and Sapling. I can go into the details but they're quite technical

Note the above comment about shielded addresses does not mean that they are supporting deposits TO a shielded address. I only see an option to deposit to a transparent address. Is it really necessary for an exchange that's bound by KYC/AML to support deposits to shielded addresses though? I'd love to hear discussion on this.
It's probably already happened somewhere too and I've missed it. Will look in forums.
wobbzz 11:33 AM
Auditing probably has something to do with shielded deposit acceptance too.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:39 PM
I don't understand why the use of Shielded addresses would be an issue for an exchange like Gemini or Coinbase that already has your KYC info. If they accept a transfer to _your_ account, they know _who_ it belongs to regardless of whether its a t-address or z-address. Same goes for outgoing transactions. (This is true for _any_ coin at any exchange because they hold the private keys)
wobbzz 1:46 PM
Good point @mineZcash . It would be helpful to understand the risk associated with sending funds shielded -> unshielded. Could that TX in some way provide an observer visibility into the value of your shielded balance or something else?
I'm thinking no, but could be missing something.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:50 PM
No, even if you post your private addresses online, say to accept donations for a charity, there is no way for anyone but the address owner to see the balance of that address.
The exchange of course would have the info about how much was sent, and be able to provide you with the TXID to look it up on chain.
They could also provide that TXID for any audit purposes to a third party. Or even use viewing keys since they control the private addresses they generate for your account.
wobbzz 1:53 PM
So auditing shouldn't be a limitation either then.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:54 PM
Agree
It may just be a matter of the back end infrastructure, it takes more work initially support private addresses than transparent.
Since T-addresses are very similar to Bitcoin it's been easier for most services to support them first
wobbzz 1:58 PM
I can imagine jumping straight into zcash sapling only support would require some additional overhead (dealing w/ viewing keys and processing requirements) but maybe they just wanted to rush to open the market on their platform while they work all of that out.
yeah that's what I'm trying to say

@mineZcash They don't hold the private keys for a destination shielded address. But the information they have plus the information on the blockchain, is no less than in the case where the account holder makes a withdrawal to a t-address and then immediately shields it

I don't understand why the use of Shielded addresses would be an issue for an exchange like Gemini or Coinbase that already has your KYC info. If they accept a transfer to _your_ account, they know _who_ it belongs to regardless of whether its a t-address or z-address. Same goes for outgoing transactions. (This is true for _any_ coin at any exchange because they hold the private keys)
I don't have any particular insight into regulatory issues since that's not my area (but other people at ZcashCo are very good at it)...
enver 5:40 AM
Question : how to shieldcoinbase that was mined to an t3 address ?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:40 AM
However, my impression is that things like this are 10% about actually being compliant, and 90% about paying lawyers to write the paperwork to convince regulators that you've followed the letter of the regulations
and note that those regulations don't *necessarily* lend themselves to using "but the customer could have done this almost equivalent thing" arguments, no matter how persuasive those arguments are to you and me

(It's not quite equivalent because the amount and any correlations to the t-address are not revealed on the blockchain, which is the point of allowing the direct shielded withdrawal. As you say, that *should* not affect AML/KYC compliance.)
@enver: is that a multisig address?
or just ordinary P2SH?
enver 5:47 AM
Multisig ...
2/3 Is that even possible
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:48 AM
@enver: eek I'm not sure how well supported that is. I suggest filing a GitHub ticket
do you have 2 of the private keys in the same wallet?
enver 5:50 AM
Yes
parsing json error
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:50 AM
in that case definitely file a ticket and give the command(s) you tried to use
I don't remember whether z_shieldcoinbase can support multisig t-addresses. it's possible to construct the transaction using zcrawjoinsplit and sign it separately, but that's really tricky
do you already have mining reward(s) in a multisig address, or are you just asking whether it would be possible to get them out?
enver 6:16 AM
Both
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:19 AM
Shielding to a Sprout address will use `signrawtransaction` under the hood, while shielding to a Sapling address will directly use the underlying transparent signing codepaths. So you might find that shielding to Sapling works. Definitely something we should test.
enver 6:30 AM
I tried both.. will try later and post the error i was geting ... is that not something an exchange could offer in the future . Lets say exchange owns 1 of 3 privatekeys and so the costumer is allways fully in control of his funds with the other 2 private keys (or 2/2) that way an hack would be kinda impossible
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:59 AM
that's feasible, yes
for t-addresses now, and probably for z-addresses in future (it might require another upgrade after Blossom)

Is it useful to add these parameters to the configuration file?
What should I do if I don't show zcash coins after importing the private key?
The block browser shows that my address is in the presence of zcash coins.
sammy007 10:54 PM
if z-tx has been mined and block orphaned this tx must go back to a mempool. It does not. Is it by design? I don't think so.

Hello,

I'm reading "4.17.2 Decryption using an Incoming Viewing Key (Sapling)" from docs description, and there is a strange part:

The recipient will attempt to decrypt the epk and Cenc components of the transmitted note ciphertext as follows:
let sharedSecret = KASapling.Agree(ivk, epk)
...

Why should we decrypt epk, since it's a public key? How do recipient derives sharedSecret from the public key (epk) ?
I can understand it in case if an epk was a encrypted sharedSecret, but how do recipient derives sharedSecret from the public key only?
Could you please explain?

Thank you!
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:49 AM
This is just ordinary Diffie-Hellman key agreement
The recipient has a public key pk_d with private key ivk and base g_d
The sender creates an ephemeral public key epk, with private key esk and the same base g_d
Then the sender computes the shared secret as [8] [esk] pk_d, and the receiver (later) computes the same secret as [8] [ivk] epk
(The [8] is cofactor multiplication, to force the result into the prime-order subgroup. That's a standard technique for Diffie-Hellman protocols, although it might not be included in some simplified descriptions of DH.)
(Also, in other descriptions of Diffie-Hellman you may see g^x where I've written [x] g, but that's purely a notational thing.]
Ephemeral just means "unique to this encryption", in this case

does the full node/light-client issue of shielded transactions only come into play when receiving a transaction (and finding all notes that belong to a user to be able to construct a transaction)? (i.e checking all transactions against viewing key).
or does some privacy issue arise when broadcasting a tx?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 10:51 AM

yes there are also privacy issues when broadcasting transactions. I think that's not something specific to light clients though

@quantafire availability in web wallets would require a JavaScript implementation. That was completely impractical for Sprout (due to performance requirements, as well as the hard task of safely converting C++ to JS). For Sapling, all the relevant code is in Rust, which we can much more easily compile for the web via WASM.

Just sent a small amount from exchange to ledger. see how it goes.

@dimitris.apostolou Gareth in the user-support channel said mining with inbuilt CPU miner is pointless. Is this true?
If so, what do you think should I do? (I know you're not an educator üòâ )
garethtdavies 9:41 AM
On mainnet your chances of finding a block are essentially zero. If it is for education purposes you can mine on the testnet (also using the improved Tromp solver by adding `equihashsolver=tromp` to `zcash.conf` will improve your hashrate). If you want to mine on mainnet then you'd need dedicated hardware.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:42 AM
Yes, it is pointless. If you are serious about mining you need to get into ASIC hardware. Although at this bear market everything is probably pointless anyway üôÇ

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:49 AM
All transactions are now Sapling transactions. If you mean shielded Sapling, they're not uncommon, just search for "shielded" in the page for a block
johann 2:51 AM
oh, thank you, yeah i meant shielded, so all shielded tx are now sapling shielded? no more vJoinSplit[] ?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:02 AM
The blockexplorer.com one is down and Zchain doesn't do a good job of showing Sapling shielded transactions, but here you go: https://explorer.zcashfr.io/insight/tx/634027ad33cf07012da1766a60fd409780a6d58fbb44c718ba005d875c0ee281
(Excuse my French.)
No, JoinSplits are still valid
On Insight explorers like that one, search for the string "-->" which only appears in the description of Sapling shielded transactions

Thanks for the suggestions, i do have Trezor wallet also. Zcash issue on ledger seemed to be from people who were mining coins and sending to the one ledger address, when they should use a new address everytime. But having used this new "Ledger Live" im not a fan of it at all, as its not very clear. I will try Trezor today also. Many thanks.
Also going to try and send from ledger live to exchange as i see from that reddit link (thanks for that) that was the problem üòê
z-888 6:30 AM
ok, so just sent 1 zec from ledger live to exchange, lets see how long it takes.
z-888 6:35 AM
Just to note, when it first checked zcash explorer it said it was not working (the explorer) but a few mins later all is good and i can see the full transaction.

i did pay the "high" fee in ledger wallet but it was only 10 sats,
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:55 AM
Good to see it worked out üôÇ
Yes, often miners have issues with lot of small transactions from mining being combined into a larger transaction for sending. Miners should set payouts higher to avoid lots of small inputs which hardware wallets struggling with.
z-888 7:37 AM
Exactly @mineZcash final note. After just over 60mins i see the ZEC on exchange (Bittrex) so no problems at all, perfectly working. From Exchange to Ledger live back to exchange again. üëå

How long does it take for the nodes to reach consensus?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:19 AM
@mariodo in Zcash the block time is 2.5mins. If a transaction has been included in a block it can be considered to have reached consensus. Else it would not have been included in that block and would wait until concensus has been reached before being included in a block or rejected by the network.
But how long it takes for your transaction to be confirmed can vary depending on network load and number of inputs in a given transaction.

If you don't let the full node maintain the wallet, them the mobile wallet will need to update shielded note witnesses and perform incoming payment detection itself. That's quite difficult. Using the libraries from the Reference Wallet will make it easier, but those haven't been released yet

I always find it interesting that he chooses to write in such a condescending tone. In all the writings of the real Satoshi I never saw any sort of big ego, it was always humble and ideological.
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:06 AM
He also completely misses a key aspect of "fungible" which is that any coin must equal to any other coin (known in Law as "mutually interchangeable"). All coins are created equal. $1 is equal to $1. As Blockchain analysis companies (and governments) continue to blacklist & sanction Bitcoin addresses how long is it until you get "stuck" with a Bitcoin that you received by legal means and now you can't spend because at one point in it's history it was in a blacklisted account?

If you have to worry about every single wallet that your Bitcoin has ever passed through then it is no longer fungible, and no longer a currency like cash.

I've already got a raw transaction (which built our library), but a node doesn't broadcast it.
It gives me an error (16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed).
The error may be in z-address generation. I'm researching it.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:19 AM
@psd There are both extended and expanded keys, which mean different things. An expanded spending key is (ask, nsk, ovk), as defined in the protocol spec. An extended spending key is a node (ask, nsk, ovk, dk, c) in the ZIP 32 derivation tree: https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/zip-0032.rst

Hey!
How is it right - Extended or Expanded spending key?
https://goo.gl/images/j5Ks36
zcashd generates all Sapling spending keys as extended keys
mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed can mean that the signature hashing is incorrect. have you checked your implementation against the test vectors in ZIP 243?
(note: I'm on holiday so I won't be able to provide much more help until January 2nd)
the consensus rules don't depend on ZIP 32, so it's unlikely that the problem here is any failure to implement the ZIP 32 derivation
so my advice would be to get it working with expanded keys first

I have a wallet address, I have his private key, confirming ownership of this address. By private key (at least written in the documentation cash), it is possible to find out what address they open.

When we tell a node to "import an address by private key" it pulls that address out of the private key, but does not tell us its (address).

How to do?

@mariodo I can't see an obvious way to do this using the RPC API. I've filed https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3748 (I suggest subscribing to notifications on that ticket, if you have a GitHub account)

    Provide a way to obtain the address of a key imported by z_importkey ¬∑ Issue #3748 ¬∑ zcash/zcash
    Reported by @mariodo on community chat. The simplest approach is probably to have z_importkey return the address of the imported key.

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:13 AM
it is possible to generate the address from the key outside `zcashd`, but to do that you would need a Rust program depending on sapling-crypto (for the case of Sapling z-addresses)
mariodo 7:16 AM
I need to display the public key on the frontend, which should be displayed after entering the private key, I do not need the generation, but the usual display of the public key that was found using the private key
In my case, the wallet was generated by the API (i.e. it is not mine)

Still have this error - An error occured:

Here is my raw transaction:
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

Do you have any ideas?

I try to build a transaction from my t-address to z-address. There are one input and two outputs (transparent output and ShieldedOutput).
For building outCiphertext, I use an ovkM parameter of my spending key. I think problem might be here.
Maybe bytes of my spending key are different of a seed for a private key for a transparent address.
So I have a question. I generate a random seed for my usually private key (for transparent address). It is 12 words phrase.
Should I use bytes from the string of this phrase? Which is a right way to build Spending key from seed?

I dont hold BTCP but in case anyone else does https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-private-denies-fraud-allegations-and-calls-for-halt-to-btcp-trading/ from article "CoinMetrics has stated they believe less than 20k legitimate BTCP coins exist in shielded addresses along with 1.7‚Äì1.8 million illegitimate coins. Our team is favoring an option to hard fork and remove all shielded coins from existence. While this would cause the 20k legitimate coins to disappear, we believe this is preferable to the alternative of leaving the 1.7‚Äì1.8 million illegitimate coins in circulation. This would also fix the over-supply issue.

It should be noted that in the original Zcash and Zclassic protocols, it‚Äôs possible to move coins out of shielded addresses, to unshielded addresses. Those who hold shielded BTCP coins are advised to do so immediately because the Bitcoin Private contribution team has said they are moving forward with this solution immediately."

Re: the BTCP fraud (yes, it is a fraud): it is quite possible to remove only the note commitments that were shielded from the illegitimately added UTXOs
That wouldn't destroy the fraudulently created money that has already been unshielded or moved within the shielded pool, but it would destroy any such money that hasn't been moved
On the other hand, I don't see why anyone would have confidence in the BTCP project as a whole, now

Only if you are running multiple ASICs. Those cost tens of thousands of dollars. Anything else will be mining at a loss. And with the current bear market, even ASICs are probably mining mostly at a loss at this moment (except if you are located in China, Mongolia, Georgia (the country), Iceland and a few more regions).

Maybe mining at a loss is fine for @johnbokker he said he's trying to learn and get something started. Mining is a great way to do that! Regardless of whether or is a profit or loss financially.
nejucomo 8:46 PM
For Sapling I believe the relationship worst case is linear for the number of inputs and outputs, so each input takes about 1-4 seconds and each output takes 0.1-1 seconds. My numbers are not exact at all, just a rough guess. I'm not sure how much that worst case guess gets better with more cores or better software (in the future).
pepesza December 27, 2018 11:25 AM
What is the relationship between number of inputs / outputs in the transaction and time needed to compute a proof of tx?
For Sprout the worst case depends on whichever is larger (inputs or outputs) and it's _basically_ the base time times the maximum of inputs or outputs. I think the base time was ~40 - 50 seconds on our reference machine. Example: 3 inputs and 5 outputs, the maximum is 5, so 5 * 50 seconds. (I'm glossing over some more details, so the time should be slightly better than that worst case. LMK if you want more details.)

@zooko You can't reduce reliance on the dev team of a coin other than by not using it. Moreover, if a coin you use is a trivial fork of another coin, then you're relying on the dev team of that other coin as well
Yes, you can audit the code yourself. In which case, you might as well publish the audit, so that everyone using the coin benefits. But you're *still* relying on the dev team if you, or anyone else, does this. It's just too easy to insert backdoors in any coin that look like plausible bugs -- and so you're relying on the dev team not to do that
An external audit will maybe have a 10% chance of finding a well-placed backdoor, if you're lucky
In addition, you're also relying on the *competence* of the dev team (and to some extent, the competence of the devs of libraries that they choose to depend on), *even if* they are completely trustworthy
An external audit can't do anything useful about a dev team not being sufficiently competent, other than detecting it (maybe, if there's no conflict of interest in the auditors reporting that)
You mentioned the possibility of an independently maintained codebase for the same protocol. This does help a little, but can it really reduce reliance on the original devs? I'm skeptical
First, is it actually independent, or does it use many of the same libraries? (The Parity "pzec" implementation is likely to be in the latter category.)
Second, does it reproduce the same bugs or specification backdoors? Due to the nature of blockchain consensus protocols, an alternate implementation *has* to be essentially bug-for-bug compatible at the consensus layer
(If you're lucky, the project of developing an alternate implementation will expose weirdnesses in the spec and bugs in the original implementation, but they won't *necessarily* be recognised as security bugs, and they won't necessarily be fixed.)
There's also the possibility that the alternate implementation can be free of a particular bug, but it's not enough, because the attack works if a majority of hash rate (for example) is running the buggy/backdoored implementation. Typically, the majority will be running the original implementation
It's even possible that a bug is triggered by a difference in the two (or more) implementations, or an interaction between them, so that auditing any one of them is not enough
In summary: I have thought deeply about the assertion that you always rely on the dev team of any coin you use. I stand by this assertion. There is no way around it.

I tend to assume most miners are somewhat financially motivated. It would be really helpful if we could learn what motivations existing miners have. For example, even among the "mining as a business" types, is their choice of business because it's the best available option for them financially, or are they choosing mining versus "better financial alternatives" because of ideals / interest? Or are they "purely financially motivated, and also expecting future exchange price rise"? What fraction are doing it to learn / support the network / etc‚Ä¶ And finally, how much of a loss are they willing to incur? https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=WxAgedbYHMKwwNXam
zooko December 29, 2018 8:34 AM
Stop making it sound like the point of mining is to make money.
For those willing to mine at a loss, it could help them to predict the financial downside, or even limit it with throttling, for example.
One of the aspects of non-ASIC PoW I find quite valuable is the ability to get Zcash or other coins without interacting with any institution other than standard ISP + the peer protocol. That might be worth some loss for some who cannot easily acquire through other means.
