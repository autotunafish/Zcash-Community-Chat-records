@vanilla1226 I'm trying to get a hang of this, do you know abouthis what kind of hardware is needed for that rate? Are there pools (if that's the right theme) one can join to?
jm9k 1:26 AM
@veikko.eeva You can calculate this pretty easily. Get the total network hashrate from here. Then divide that by the total number of ZEC distributed to miners per day, which is 576. That will be the hashrate you need to mine 1 ZEC a day. A single RX 480 GPU will give you about 230 sols/s. Now you can calculate how many GPUs you need to mine 1 ZEC a day.

@jm9k Hey, that helped quickly. So I can conclude from this 230 sol/s is the same as hash rate, I suppose.

    Mac OS X gui wallet with embedded zcashd BETA
    After a lot of hard work by @zab and myself in adapting the Swing Gui wallet by @vaklinov for Mac OS, we've finally got a beta of a nice, shiny Mac dmg installer with an all-in-one app for testing! It has the jvm, zcashd, everything needed to run the wallet with a local full node of zcash baked into it. If you've already got the proving key's downloaded for use with my Mac port (source or binary release), it'll use them without re-downloading. If its a fresh, untouched Mac that's never had Zca...

Mm, really, really strange this libsnark problem. For instance, `r1cs_ppzsnark_pp.hpp` is regenerated (I haven't yet figured out where) and it includes `#include "common/default_types/ec_pp.hpp"`, even though the file is in the same location. I'm not sure if the error

    > C:/msys64/home/Veikko/zcash/depends/x86_64-pc-mingw64/include/libsnark/common/default_types/r1cs_ppzksnark_pp.hpp:19:9: error: 'default_ec_pp' does not name a type

    > typedef default_ec_pp default_r1cs_ppzksnark_pp;

is the result of this exact thing. Moreover, if removing some other linker error has resulted to this.
Talking aloud, in case it helps. 🙂

@veikko.eeva Check out Flypool or Suprnova for mining pools to start with
veikko.eeva 9:12 AM
@vanilla1226 OK.
The problem in the build seem to come from how the paths are searched. One option could be to rearrange the code more consistently, perhaps, but I suppose it's not the option to pursue currently.

    > [...] Resisting the urge to take the bitcoins and run, I reported this to their bug bounty program and it was patched within an astounding 20 minutes. [...] Some websites make classic URL parsing mistakes when attempting to verify whether an origin should be trusted. For example, a site which I'll call advisor.com trusts all origins that ended in advisor.com, including definitelynotadvisor.com. Even worse, a second bitcoin exchange (let's call it btc.net) trusted all Origins that started with https://btc.net, including https://btc.net.evil.net. Unfortunately the site unexpectedly and permanently ceased operations before I could build a working proof of concept. I won't speculate as to why.

i dunno 400 Sol/s per card at 800w to the wall... also looks like they are finally getting GDDR5x memory going in the miners for the 1080
(7 cards)
jm9k 10:56 PM
What is your total sols/s?

2800
pretty new to mining so i'm sure it could probably be better

2800 sol/s at 800 watts?
zecminer36 10:58 PM
yes, that's why it's getting interesting
trying to find someone out there with a 1080 to see what they are doing these days
jm9k 11:00 PM
That's a really good return for 800 watts.
zecminer36 11:01 PM
i think nicehash is coming out w/ something in the next couple days that really pushes the 1080s with GDDR5x...
jm9k 11:01 PM
However, the investment is 75% more for equal sol/s
zecminer36 11:01 PM
what do you use for cards?
jm9k 11:01 PM
AMD RX 480
That's the most popular for most GPU based mining.
zecminer36 11:02 PM
monero/ETH i assume?

It has had the quickest pay off rate for Zcash and Ethereum.
I haven't looked into Monero mining recently, but I probably should.

That's pretty interesting that the GTX1080 has such good performance. Quite frankly I'm surprised. Historically AMD has had vastly superior capabilities for mining based on fundamental hardware differences from nVidia.

zaki.manian 10:34 AM
baradim It's really not that complicated. Programs can be compiled into form called arithmetic circuits. These correct execution of these circuits can be verified using pairing cryptography. One can prove that the verifier learns nothing about the secret inputs to the program other than the output. Zcash uses a protocol that requires the prove that they correctly generated a set of merkle trees to spend money.
This is SNARKS in a nutshell. I can point you are bibliography if you want greater detail

Quick dumb question: How do I attain a zcash wallet address?
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:29 PM
You can get an address by using a wallet like jaxx, or starting a Zcash node, or if you have an account at an exchange you can generate one there to receive funds.
But note that the jaxx wallet and exchanges only support transparent (not private) transactions for now, if you want a private transaction you will have to start a node
vanilla1226 2:08 PM
@floyd You can also use Kraken or Bittrex, both support ZEC wallets
veikko.eeva 2:13 PM
@mineZcash Well, Some sort of a contributor guideline and a description over the various parts. Things like is it OK to submit fixes even to typos (of course!), is it OK to clean up code (a matter of argument sometimes, but we could have guidelines such as check arguments on public functions or encouring to submit fixes, refactorings etc.). Things that could interest the more casual programmers. I might have missed if there ar such things already, though.

I see, cause that figure I assu
lokko 7:34 PM
total is 372,000 x 49,- =XXX
crypto.world 7:34 PM
That figure I assume is relatively slow Mining compared to Bitcoin when it first came out in 2008? It appears it's harder to Mine Zcash & that's the reason why prices have stabilised? Would it be true to assume based on current rates /speed of mining, the demand /supply will favour Zcash long term as more miners come on board
lokko 7:36 PM
Yes I think so too
but that only works if there is no way for an asic miner
as soon as the demand is rising and they will rise, will rise zcash !
alone already by the slow removal, but only if there is no asic miner
the zcash team is doing everything right ! and I trust them 1000%
important it is to find distribution channels
And the anonymity will prevail,, I can only say, it speaks for zcash, which they reported in the usa, Better than as on the cayman islands !!!
lokko 7:52 PM

NO :-)))

Well I trust Apple too & the amazing job Steve Jobs did in revolutionising the world we live in, I think with new technologies & the fact BTC is nearly all mined, ASIC mining will soon become extinct & the power, noise , difficultly Rates I would imagine will lead more mining into Zcash, but more importantly it's about what Zcash & its application is all about, on par with smart Contracts & DAO , I'm hoping both ETH & ZEC are adopted the same way BTC is now adopted

What is the best ec2 Instance Type?
really!? what is profitable for zcash then
thanks for the tip, have you seen/used the "gpu compute" ec2 instance types?
oh, ok so it was the first couple weeks
laynr 1:22 PM
FYI - just spun up a "t2.small" ec2 instance and ran v0.4b of ./nheqminer_cpu -b yielded 2.02205 Sols/s.... my lap top does 5Sol/s so moving on, will try bunch mark on other instances
laynr 1:42 PM
m4.large = 3.63009 Sols/s
laynr 1:53 PM
c3.8xlarge = 35.3991 Sols/s
what is the Sols/s range for GPU rigs?
laynr 2:00 PM
I am looking at the top miners on https://zcash.flypool.org/ . For hash rate does H/s= Sols/s?

    zcash.flypool.org
    Home - zcash.flypool.org
    The Zcash Mining Pool

so kH/s= 1000 Sols/s
laynr 2:12 PM
c4.8xlarge = 59.3981 Sols/s
laynr 2:24 PM
m4.16xlarge = 76.6177 Sols/s
laynr 2:40 PM
x1.32xlarge = 3.94017 Sols/s
laynr 2:49 PM
correction; r4.large = 3.94017 Sols/s (not x1.32xlarge)
laynr 2:57 PM
r4.8xlarge = 47.3448 Sols/s
ademola 3:04 PM
i need top miners too
laynr 3:06 PM
r3.8xlarge = 35.5209 Sols/s and that concludes my testing. proved the obvious. More CPUs = greater SOLs for CPU mining. I guess it is good it moved to GPU mining so there is less incentive for bot nets.
I still like to hear some numbers for GPU mining

I'm too a rookie to make up a claim to a direction or another, but from a more enterprise perspective, it probably is the otherway around that ensuring the core team can afford bread, shelter, electricity and so forth is only a sane thing. That in addition someone has some sort of authority to assert over the policy. Kind of how Ripple works, but other purpose (initially at least).

Hmm, something about contracts and Turing completeness. It has occurred to me something like https://www.google.fi/?gws_rd=ssl#q=deontic+logic+law. Like belief-desire-intention (BDI) is somewhat widely utilized in games, but it looks to me deontic logic goes more formal and deeper. My thinking is probably influenced a bit on doing things around actors systems (Orleans) and looking at different kind of concencus, but it looks to me actors could be contracts and specifically considering Orleans, which is .NET, and F# and from there F*, https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar, going program verification route with actor systems and mix-match of concensus might make an interesting case.

Actor systems are like assembly for multi-agent systems. It's interesting what the future holds in that respect. 🙂
Multi-agent systems are concensus -- and don't need to run just by one kind of a protocol. Here's on particularly interesting case: http://futurict.inn.ac/.

Only the first tx of genesis block can't be found, other txs can be found, why?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:18 PM
The genesis block was generated using different software, so there might be various funky things about it
For example, it should have included a "height in coinbase" transaction, but didn't
(So we had to add a validation exception for that.)
This might also be related to the bug in Bitcoin where the mining reward from the coinbase transaction of the genesis block can't be spent
(Since the Zcash genesis block has a mining reward of zero due to slow start, we didn't bother to fix that bug.)

Where on the Zcash roadmap is improved usability? I decided to finally try out Zcash locally, but found that it only on 64-bit linux, there is no *official* docker image, there is no GUI, there doesn't appear to be a library version nor does there appear to be a standalone server version (interactable only via API).

Note: This is not a complaint as I understand that these things are probably not currently high priorities for the development team. However, I would like to get a better understanding of how they are being prioritized relative to other tasks as I believe they are a critical component of a successful blockchain.

It is a good enough answer to my question, which is how does UX compare to other concerns. Looks like most of the UX related things are a ways out.

not asking when, but whats next
micah.zoltu 2:50 PM
It also gives me an idea about how much thought has been put into UX, and so far the answer appears to be "not a lot".
When it comes to investing, the first lets me know that I should expect a fairly distant time horizon for adoption. The second lets me know that there is some risk that Zcash won't successfully solve the UX problems, or it they will continue to be put off indefinitely.
I will admit, a nice clean roadmap would be a nicer interface to that data.

I tried to find on web but no luck.
my setup: Ethos 1.1.8 + claymore miner + jaxx wall + nanopool. Using 6 gpu to mine.
* jaxx wallet
Q. how to verify fine miner is actually mining ?

Go to nanopool and check if you are getting mining credit.
ajay 5:03 PM
Appreciate your reply...
currently I am checking.
on zec.nanopool.org on my jaxx wallet id.
it does not show any hash rate.
my rig is running almost 20 hr now.
and on my rig i can we 1500 h/s rate.
Q. the id we get from jaxx is the public addresses (t-addr) ?
because what i see on my id page
nanopool is saying "only public addresses (t-addr) are supported now."
and on nanopool page i can see my worker but no hashrate.
and same t-addr configure in my local.conf file

Hmm, OK. Do you have plans to provide an easy-to-use API to interface with (for integrations), an SPV protocol (for light clients), an official server build (runs in background, no CLI) or a library version (no CLI, no external API) or other things that make it easy for people to develop tooling for Zcash?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:26 PM
@zooko do we know who runs that zcashblog on wordpress?
micah.zoltu 3:30 PM
Expecting third parties to take on the role of making Zcash easy to use is a tall order, and risky for Zcash investors if no one good shows up. In my experience open source UXs tend to be rather terrible since building a good UX is expensive; it requires user testing, rounds of feedback and iteration, a team (designers + product managers + engineers) that isn't very common in the OSS world. Of course, there is a business opportunity for a third party to "solve" UX but it is tough to come up with a good business model for this sort of thing (as has historically been a problem in blockchain tech).
Unfortunately, those most invested in the success of the UX for a blockchain are those with substantial stake in the chain (presumably the Zcash team in this case).
I would be curious if anyone has any ideas for a business model that could pay off for improving the UX of individual blockchains.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 4:57 PM
@micah.zoltu I'm not sure what you're referring to about the API. The API is the RPC interface, just like in Bitcoin. We're continuously making improvements to the usability of that
zcashd runs in the background if you give it the -daemon option (on the command line or in zcash.conf)
micah.zoltu 5:05 PM
I'm not very familiar with the Bitcoin JSON-RPC interface or its usability. Being a pessimist who has been in software for a while, I am internally defaulting to the assumption that the API is terrible, but for the sake of this discussion lets assume it is great. 🙂
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:06 PM
it has some limitations that we need to fix (e.g. only being able to send from one address using z_sendmany)
as JSON-RPC interfaces go, I've seen worse
micah.zoltu 5:10 PM
What I am imagining is someone wanting to ship a full Zcash UX solution, and what that would require. If we assume the Windows/OSX ports get finished, then one would want to package up a UI along with the "backend". There are a number of ways to accomplish this:
1. a library that is baked in
2. a "server" that runs in the background and is accessed by the UI via network
3. a baked in SPV type client
4. a signer only client that communicates with a remote
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:10 PM
as for library versions, I think it's better to have a thin language binding that talks to zcashd over the RPC interface. There's not much advantage in doing what zcashd does in-process, and it's really complicated to support that
micah.zoltu 5:11 PM
Agreed, but packaging multiple processes is much harder (installers are hard, background services are hard, etc.)
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:11 PM
I'm biased somewhat by experience with another project, Tahoe-LAFS, which provides both a RPC (REST) interface and a library interface, where literally no-one uses the latter
micah.zoltu 5:11 PM
Really? I'm rather surprised by that.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:12 PM
(it's a Python interface, in that case)
micah.zoltu 5:12 PM
Having had to write installers before, by far the easiest is a program that is just a single executable with maybe a configuration file.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:13 PM
well, packaging sucks on all platforms
micah.zoltu 5:13 PM
Installation on OS X, for example, usually consists of a user dropping a package into their `Applications` folder. If your service needs stuff to run in the background you have to hook all that up to happen on first run, connect to existing thing if already there, coordinate port binding, etc.
Yeah, we can wholeheartedly agree on that.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:13 PM
I rarely find that single executables are practical
micah.zoltu 5:14 PM
I do suspect that for a full-node client, it isn't realistic.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:14 PM
I may be wrong, but on OS-X isn't that package really multiple files in an archive?
micah.zoltu 5:14 PM
Yeah, it is. The act of packaging the files up into the archive isn't hard, it is connecting them all at runtime that gets tricky.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:15 PM
I thought it acted as a pseudo-directory?
micah.zoltu 5:15 PM
The user will "launch" the archive, which under the hood will need to ensure that the service is running, ensure the port it is bound to is open (and if not bind to a different port), communicate the bound port to the front-end client, launch the client with that, etc.
I believe it does.
Don't get me wrong, none of this is impossible.
But it is "hard" compared to just compiling against a library.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:15 PM
ok, so there being multiple files isn't the problem per se. I agree there's some overhead with multiple processes
micah.zoltu 5:16 PM
@radix42 How do you deal with the UX communicating with the Zcash service?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:16 PM
but the binding to a particular language can handle launching the server. then it's kind of an implementation detail whether that server is in-process or not
micah.zoltu 5:16 PM
Do you require the user to already be running Zcash in daemon mode or do you hook that up for them?
So when the user launches the bundle, it will check to see if the service is running, and if not launch it, then launch the UI and connect to the service?
What happens if the JSON-RPC port is in use or someone has another Zcash client running on the same machine?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:18 PM
yep, @radix42's stuff is awesome. I hope we can merge it into the main codebase soon
micah.zoltu 5:20 PM
Personally, I'm more interested in SPV/signing only clients, which is where having a baked-in-library makes more sense (no giant chain to share).
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:20 PM
yes, I agree with that
there must be Bitcoin SPV libraries that could be adapted
micah.zoltu 5:21 PM
For t-addresses probably.
For z-addresses I believe there are some technical hurdles still (there are some issues in the backlog I saw on the subject).
veikko.eeva 12:59 AM
@micah.zoltu I considered those scenarios being the drivers also in https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1993. I see there is great opportunity in many fronts to make life easier. I have a branch where I just shoved stuff quickly together to make it compile (as in something, not the whole thing), but I got stalled by influenza the last week. Plus I've examined CMake more carefully and how to write better makefiles. It looks like it has parts that helps, for instance, packaging and making them more consumable by downostream developers, ZCash developers etc.
This is not to claim this will make it to the main repo, but I think I should work on making a good case to see how it looks like. At some point I clean up the mess in branch so it's easier to see what's going on there.
Otherwise agreed on what @radix42 is making happen. He's pushing really hard. 🙂
jm9k 1:49 AM
I have to second @micah.zoltu on the point of general usability. The UI/UX is essential to gain acceptance by the masses. It also indirectly invokes trust in the platform. Monero's recent skyrocket has undoubtedly been helped by the release of the UI wallet. Trust is a huge issue, and there are scammers out there looking for opportunities. If someone is dealing in Zcash, they are never going to trust a third party more than Zcash.

I'm sure a full UI solution is a wishlist item that simply may not be in the budget. UI is a costly endeavor. Even the biggest up-and-comers are struggling. Ethereum's Wallet is kind of a jumble. Augur's UI/UX is a disaster (and unsurprisingly they have a position open for a UI Engineer). But perhaps there is a secondary solution, even if just in the short run. What if Zcash was to publish an official third party wallet recommendation, and give at least some minor assurance by working directly with the third party developer and auditing each release?

I wouldn't rule out the Zcash core team making an end-user facing app/product/service/site, if we found an opportunity where it seemed like we'd be better at it than anyone else would.
Especially going forward over the next few years, when Zcash development is likely to diversify and intensify, with the addition of The Zcash Foundation, probably new commercial enterprises building on Zcash, more open source/volunteer/community efforts like the various ones we've already seen, etc.
Currently we are focusing on improving the infrastructure layer, e.g. the things you mentioned, but our _attention_ and our thinking is driven by end-users and mass market.

zooko Electric Coin Company 9:55 AM
I think the answer is "To make transactions look as much like each other as possible, for privacy."
If you optimize out unused parts of a transaction, that allows a spy studying the blockchain to learn facts about transactions, by observing their size or which parts are being used.

micah.zoltu 7:29 PM
@george.k Zcash and Monero aim to solve similar problems (anonymizing transactions), but they take very different approaches. Honestly, from an anonymity standpoint I'm of the opinion that both are about as effective as each other. That is, effective enough for all reasonable use cases so to most users that shouldn't be what drives your decision. More importantly to me is how well each integrates with other blockchains, the business/development model that each of the development teams follow, and the general UX.
This is obviously a bit biased as this is the Zcash community, but I have more faith overall in Zcash, though the current UX situation leaves me questioning a bit, especially compared with ShadowCash whose primary focus is on UX or Monero who at least has a cross platform wallet out. Zcash has a sustainable development model (e.g., they can actually pay their developers) and they have some very smart people working on the backend as well as professional investors which tends to drive towards quality UX over time. Per conversations above though, end-user experience improvements are a ways out on the roadmap so there is risk that ShadowCash or Monero come to a "complete solution" and corner the market before Zcash can hit its stride.
I personally think that (based on current data and trajectory) if Zcash can survive long enough to not lose to Monero/ShadowCash due to the network effect then it will dominate the market in the long run. If Zcash can't provide a complete solution soon enough though, they may end up being another "cool tech, but not differentiated enough to end-users" to succeed.
I'm still hopeful, and I haven't been following Zcash long enough to have an idea of what their development velocity is like which is why the timeline thing is a risk factor in my eyes.

@lustro, what's the meaning of the "Shielded" value in the transactions on your explorer, https://explorer.zcha.in/?
For a transaction involving a JoinSplit, we can't know what shielded value is passing through; we can only lower-bound it by the absolute value of the difference in transparent values.
So may I suggest the following logic?
If there's no JoinSplit, "Shielded" is 0.
If there's a JoinSplit, "Shielded" should be "≥x" where x = | ( sum of transaction's transparent inputs ) - (sum of transaction's transparent outputs + transaction fee) | .

lustro 11:37 AM
@tromer The original intent was something like "previously transparent value shielded by a transaction", calculated as the sum of the difference between vpub_old and vpub_new in the joinsplits where vpub_old - vpub_new was positive. Your definition makes more sense - would it be useful to display positive/negative values instead of the absolute value? That way "shielded value" just means "(negative) net change in the transparent output pool".
tromer Zcash Foundation 11:42 AM
@lustro, ah, now I get what you intended. But I think that when looking at an individual transaction, it's less interesting to think about change in total shielded vs. transparent pool size (which is tracked elsewhere), and more natural to ask "how much shielded ZEC was passed around" (same as for the transparent amount). Hence the proposed "≥" and the absolute value.
lustro 11:46 AM
I see - that does make sense; I'll update the site in the next few days (v2 API coming along with some more stats; I'll bundle that in). I think I'll also put a disclaimer on hover with a link to more information (mostly to make it clear that a transaction with ">= 0" shielded value could be transferring thousands of ZEC).

yo
are there any zcash exchanges that don't require accounts or javascript?
bedaxen 9:03 PM
bummer
anonymous cryptocurrencies aren't very anonymous when personally identifying information can be associated with the transaction
jm9k 9:12 PM
@bedaxen Getting from cash to the coin is the issue. You could probably use prepaid credit cards if you really wanted to.
You could also mine.
bedaxen 9:15 PM
buying zcash anonymously isn't the problem. It's converting it to bitcoin anonymously that's the issue
doing that requires an exchange that doesn't require accounts or javascript
I've seen exchanges that take ZEC and BTC that don't require accounts (ie. shapeshift.io)
However, they require javascript
maybe the api is the way to go
bedaxen 9:29 PM
Thanks
I just have to wonder... How is this not the central issue surrounding zcash usability?
If one didn't care about anonymity at all, why would one bother with zcash in the first place? We have Bitcoin.
pick any random bitcoin clone and the speed problem goes away
Exactly. Since one does care about anonymity, then zcash *should* make sense.
But it doesn't, because you can't buy it anonymously
Which invalidates zcash's central purpose
all it would take is just *one* exchange that didn't require accounts or javascript. Just one.
ok. lets say I use a regular browser in incognito mode with shapeshift. Does shapeshift.io know my IP address?
ok. let's say I use a regular browser in incognito mode to access shapeshift.io via tor. Does shapeshift.io know my IP address?
no. shapeshift.io or anyone injecting malware into my randomly chosen browser that runs javascript will happily reveal my IP to them
which is why you don't use a randomly chosen browser (incognito mode or not) with tor. They all run javascript (and hence, javascript malware)
so the answer is: yes. shapeshift.io would know my ip address
then I must be smarter than anyone who ever thought of an anonymous cryptocurrency, let alone created it, let alone used it
unless it's the elephant in the room
less complication = less work
I'd be your first customer
just... when you do it. keep it super-simple. run it with a public face as a standard business. Just connect it to tor as a hidden site in addition to it's standard public face. No javascript. No accounts. Just BTC <--> ZEC
which is really just shapeshift.io minus bullshit fancy javascript-whatever.. with a tor onion address
which is to say... shapeshift.io could just do this with a non-js interface and a tor hidden service. Voila! Done.
hell.. just keep it ZEC <--> BTC... what other cryptocurrencies would you need anyway
maybe etherium
Ethereum
I read an article about someone merging zcash with Ethereum smart contracts
In truth, if I can find just *one* existing exchange that does this now, then I'm done. I'll just use them.
just add zec and btc to start with
btc for its wide-spread adoption
zec for its anonymity
if anything else, eth for smart contracts
i gotta say.. this is the one missing link to zec
bedaxen 10:02 PM
I think I'll just use their API
I just need to write a script to interface with it and bypass web/javascript/whatever
it's probably the best way to go for anyone in this situation. I'll just throw it up on github and the world can download it and run it, as needed.
micah.zoltu 10:07 PM
@bedaxen What sort of de-anonymizing vectors are you trying to defend against?
State actors? If so, just the act of connecting to a central server will give you away. You should be going through VPNs, Tor, etc.
As for JavaScript, again if you are worried about state actors then you should be using a computer that is used for nothing else other than such transactions.
If, on the other hand, you aren't worried about states tracking you then you can just run an InPrivate/Incognito browser.
You could even do that via one VPN and probably be safe against anything other than a targeted state level attack against you personally.

    👍 2 

jm9k 10:55 PM
I'm with @micah.zoltu on this. Don't worry about the Javascript BS. I suggest using a virtual machine with a VPN and Tor browser stacked. If you want a VPN suggestion, Google for "PIA".
The VM with a clean OS install will help to protect against another installed app running in the background and leaking information on whatever IP you're using. Snapshots are also handy for reverting to a clean state when finished.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:53 AM
@gjwang Also, there's nothing that forces t-addrs "by default"
They are two independent transaction types, so the "default" is mostly just user convention at this point

    👍 2 

But it's also partly because all services currently only accept t-addrs for the reason @radix42 stated
You might notice that the new Zcash RPC z_sendmany works with both address types. This means that users, services and apps can add z-addr support by adding support for newer RPCs
(rather than just relying on the older Bitcoin APIs)
Mmm. The Bitcoin-style one-address-per-transaction does not work here
Well, all that does is process addresses in parallel
The wallet code could be parallelized instead, or in addition
Most of that was bugs that have been fixed now
I'd be interested to know the reindex time of a pool now
Although one pool did say they still run into issues as their wallet approaches 200MB in size.
Yeah, that's the main migration issue at the moment

veikko.eeva 1:13 PM
Cheers, guys. Having a quick look and no luck this time. Using Notepad++ to just open files isn't efficient, though. If I read the intention of that piece right, it transforms `this->pb.lc_val(packed)` into `bigint` (int64_t?), counts the number of bits and does the comparison? What does `num_bits` do?
tromer Zcash Foundation 1:15 PM
It returns the number of bits in the specific value, i.e., position of the most-significant 1 bit.
The asserts says there are enough elements in `bits` to represent that value.

Sorry for being absent, leafing through the code, now bigint.tcc
Really suspicious to see something like `ULONG_MAX`, which I think are platform dependent.
I may have old code, looking at

```
template<mp_size_t n>
bigint<n>::bigint(const unsigned long x) /// Initalize from a small integer
{
    static_assert(ULONG_MAX <= GMP_NUMB_MAX, "unsigned long does not fit in a GMP limb");
    this->data[0] = x;
}

```

Yep.
I wonder if it would make sense to be explicit about the size of those and even use http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/types/numeric_limits.
Or in other words, might be less tedious if it were explicit without ifdefs depending on platform. 🙂
veikko.eeva 1:45 PM
I'm trying to find how is that `GMP_NUMB_BITS` defined.
They always look so suspicious. 🙂
I haven't never come across such a system, but `char` isn't necessarily 8 bits either. 🙂 Probably doesn't matter, but I throw some trivia here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/75191/what-is-an-unsigned-char. This isn't helpful, but maybe someone finds these interesting to glance through.

    stackoverflow.com
    What is an unsigned char?
    In C/C++, what an unsigned char is used for? How is it different from a regular char?

@radix42 That is a good find about `mpir`. It takes effort to dig through such information.
Oh the woes... There are probably still people who oppose to modules and stable ABIs.

So as I was reading it — and as you know I'm pretty good at "simulating" an ignorant and easily-confused user — I thought it wasn't clear that in the initial example (b.) Bob is not known to the viewer.
So I imagined a variation: inscribe "Alice", "Bob", and "Carol" onto the golden circles of (a.), and inscribe "Alice", "?", and "Carol" onto (b.). What do you think?

Hi everyone, I'm trying to develop something similar to https://github.com/sammy007/zcash-proxy (but open source and free). I currently have a stratum proxy developed, but now i need to take the stratum mining.submit requests from a miner and make it compatible with the protocols used for solo mining. I've read the white paper but can't find much on submitting work. Anyone want to help a noobie out?

I remember Zcash team claiming that Zec should be worth 1/3 of BTC before it started mining. From the most "Hyped" " to the most unwanted CryptoCurrency, it appears Zcash/privacy/snarks are not valued
anarch3 3:13 PM
it does have a 20 million market cap
paige Admin Moderator 3:14 PM
@crypto.world and do you have a reference for that claim beyond memory?
crypto.world 3:19 PM
Market Cap of 20 Mil is minute compared to several of the other CryptoCurrencies, it's also misleading cause Zcash is being Mined which increases the pool, compare the Zec price to BTC, Eth, USD,Euro, & other CryptoCurrencies & you'll see it's lost & continuing to lose value against them.
zooko Electric Coin Company 3:24 PM
@crypto.world: did you see Paige's question? I really doubt anyone from our team said anything like that.
At least, not if by "team" we mean the company. I wouldn't be surprised if lots of enthusiastic members of the broader community said all kinds of things like that. 😉
crypto.world 3:36 PM
Radix- the. current fiat price is not important, if we use your measurement & analogy then keep in mind on opening of mining -Zec was 33,000 BTC. , that's over 2 Million. Now we all knew those prices would come tumbling down, what is more relevant is after 3 months it's losing value against every other Crptocurrency.
anarch3 3:49 PM
fiat rate is important even if you see cryptocurrncies as stocks
crypto.world 4:14 PM
Of course fiat rates are important, I was merely highlighting the decline in Zec compared to other CryptoCurrencies & Fiat currencies. Market Cap of 20 Mill is minimal & keep in mind Zec mining increases the Zcash pool, for example if all 21 Mill Zec were Mined & the fiat price dropped to US $1.00 then it's Market Cap would still be 21 Million. After all the initial hype , it appears the market has taken a negative view on Zec, this can be observed by thin trading volumes, and perceived negativity surrounding the Founders 10% slice over few years, its initial opening launch price & from a Development point of view is still in experimental mode.
jm9k 4:38 PM
The initial price drop was a natural result of the initial hype and then hyperinflation. If you look at the marketcap it is still on a general up trend. This is very positive since the inflation rate is decreasing, and will continue to decrease.

crypto.world 9:09 PM
The graph above may indicate similar fiat price movements, I'm referring to the overall concept & adoption of Zcash. The press/media hailed Zcash as bleeding edge technology & whilst Zcash has similar features using same platform to Bitcoin, Zcash was viewed superior with the anonymity/privacy/ Ksnarks with the most advanced Crptograhpy technologies, all the initial excitement & enthusiasm has disappeared with the supply/demand volumes showing not much interest , price is being hammered on exchanges & continuing its downward spiral since it launched. I hope the Company has a specialist marketing/PR person who can sell the concept to large scale institutions & organisations cause the price right now is being dictated by small "Dad & Mum" traders who most likely have no understanding of the Fundamentals & only interested in graphs/candlesticks to buy/sell they're small Zec holdings
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:10 PM
In reality, it's still up on launch, because IIRC most exchanges opened at a BTC level equivalent to US$15
But I agree that the main users of ZEC currently are miners and exchange speculators
(primarily IMHO because the only services with easy Zcash support happen to be exchanges!)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:20 PM
So there's a lot of usability work to do. The user side has a head start there with the various wallets (both existing ones that added Zcash support, and from-scratch Zcash GUI wallets), and the community work on cross-platform builds will help there. On the service side, IIRC there are already several issues open for different API improvements (but it's 5am and I've only had an hour's sleep, so trust the issue tracker over me!)

I have heard good things about http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page

    nsis.sourceforge.net
    NSIS Wiki

The hardest part for you will probably be ensuring Java is installed.
Ah, that is nice.
Does it correctly clean up on uninstall?
In particular, remove generated files like config and chain data.
(stuff the app creates)
Yeah, leaving the wallet is probably a good idea. Make sure to not delete any existing wallets on install. 🙂
Ugh. This all reminds me of how much of a pain writing installers is. It is all the edge cases that get you.
Not removing chain data is a bit rude. In most cases, user is probably uninstalling the clear up space.
Good luck!

I'm trying to backup my zcash wallet (t and z addresses). is it sufficient to backup the wallet.dat file or do I have to run the z_exportwallet command?
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:29 PM
so z_exportwallet is used when mergeing wallets?
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:33 PM
okay, thanks!
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:34 PM
... maybe something to improve in the docs there: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/doc/payment-api.md sais how to use z_exportwallet but doesn't say how to unlock the wallet (which is required). I've yet not found a doc that tells me how to unlock the wallet...

[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:40 PM
hmm. dunno why the zcash-cli is complaining about my wallet not beeing unlocked then
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:41 PM
when it's unlocked by default now I guess there's been a wallet format change
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:41 PM
my wallet is a beta wallet. so I guess I still have to unlock it atleast once?
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:41 PM
and then... upgrade it to the new "always unlocked" format?
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:50 PM
now: latest 1.0.5
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:51 PM
but my wallet is a beta wallet.
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:52 PM
so, back then the wallet was locked by default. if now the default is to have it unlocked I'll have to unlock it atleast once - correct? Maybe I'm getting it wrong...
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:53 PM
so, maybe we should define "beta". for me anything before 1.x release was beta
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:53 PM
dunno about the official wording here
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:54 PM
but I was on the testnet before (alpha) and I also mined some "real" zc in the wallet I now have
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:54 PM
hmm
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:55 PM
hmmm. no. I guess I'm just confusing numbers here.
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:55 PM
the wallet was created on the mainnet, AFTER oct 28. 2016 and the genesis block
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:55 PM
so, if you say thats post 1.x it must have been some 1.x release.
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:56 PM
was it "unlocked by default" for every 1.x release? if so, i guess my wallet should already be unlocked
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:58 PM
hmm. strange why the export command wants me to unlock my wallet then.
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:59 PM
there's am
[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:59 PM

[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 12:59 PM

[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 1:01 PM

[OFTC/m451] @rocket.cat Bot 1:04 PM

@cryptocastles, @radix42 Yeah, I'm (slowler than I originally though) working towards CMake system. Life got in a way, but I'm working on it and picking up speed. Partially my slowdown has been that besides a daily job, time has gone on "evening job" and having a string of meetings and discussions with potential ZCash users. That is, ZCash is mentioned and has poked interest. Seeking cooperation and maintaining "good will" as well as the governance model seem to interest favourable. I can't give names or talk what's been specifically talked, but I can tell there's interest on ZCash in the Nordics. For instance https://twitter.com/pekkakaipio has some mentions of ZCash on the timeline. OP, for one, is quite a large financial conglomerate in the Nordics and these companies have dropped something like a billion euros to get Ripple running.

This is my humble thinking, but the European GDPR regulations coming into force are partly pushing financial institutions to consider privacy solutions like this. GDPR levies hefty fines (max was 4% of turnover/profit, I don't recall which or 40 million euros, whichever is higher) on security leaks or disregard of user privacy and then there's the right to be forgotten or to be seen who can see and use the information. Obviously financial institutions can't share data with each other, nor they want, and they need to come up new revenue models in the new world (and how to compate against companies such as Facebook that doesn't currently have all the same problems).

As a (n awkward) transition to @radix42's note on the DLLS, in newer Windowses some core DLLs are actually split during the kernel rewrites. Currently, I think, Microsoft builds from the same source HoloLens, XBox, PC, mobile devices etc. That `kernel32.dll` for instance is such a pass-through dll to `kernelbase.dll` and whatnot. This is not the Microsoft of the 2000s, much of their stuff is OSS in GH and Russinovich went on record telling it's not an impossible idea to open-source Windows too. Some tech and stuff from MS core is finding its way to OSS in some places already too. 🙂 Which leads me to Orleans (https://github.com/dotnet/orleans) which is quite a welcoming community dealing with other kind of concencus problems. The connection is that GDPS stipulates even stale data in caches can be in violation of GDPR (imagine someone altering personal records and they're being cached somewhere for too long), which actor system have easier time explicitly handling. Then MS is also propping up its paymento offerings, I wonder if https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2016/12/15/payment-request-api-edge could use bitcoins, hmm. 🙂

    Simpler web payments: Introducing the Payment Request API - Microsoft Edge Dev Blog
    We’re thrilled to introduce a preview implementation of the Payment Request API in Microsoft Edge, enabling simpler checkout and payments on the web on Windows 10 PCs and Phones. Support for Payment Request in stable builds will be coming to EdgeHTML 15 in the Creators Update early next year. Payment Request works with Microsoft Wallet …

That was a convoluted one. tl;dr As far as I can see, there are probably more eyes in Nordic Countries looking at ZCash than can be detected without walking here.
@micah.zoltu Plenty of Windows users are relucantant to install Java too. 🙂
@radix42 We should wrap the binaries to a nice .NET shim, deploy it to Nuget... Aand make a non-Java client. 😇
micah.zoltu 3:13 PM
I'm a fan of the trend towards browser clients with a little daemon running in the background.
As much as I hate JS, HTML and JavaScript, there is *tons* of online resources for building GUIs (that look nice) that run in a browser.
Parity (new Rust Ethereum client) does this and I find the experience to be pretty nice. And if you want to package it up in a deployable desktop app you can bundle it into Electrum.
veikko.eeva 3:15 PM
@micah.zoltu http://fable.io/ Building a proper MVVM in F# could run both on desktop and in browser without that many modifications, I could think. They could integrate with Aurelia. 😉

Ah, and MS should get their act together on F#.
micah.zoltu 3:17 PM
Functional programming is a hard paradigm for users to buy-into because it is so different from the paradigms (OOP) they are used to.
Every functional language has the same problem, they are all too big of shifts for most users to jump head-fist into.
Which is why MS decided to just add functional concepts to C#, so people can ease in.
veikko.eeva 3:18 PM
@micah.zoltu It looks to me the 10+ years of lambdas and LINQ on C# has smoothened the curve considerably.

micah.zoltu 3:18 PM
Same thing with Kotlin on the JVM.
anarch3 3:18 PM
unless its java
micah.zoltu 3:18 PM
You are correct in that. 🙂 I definitely support running on the CLR, especially now that that it is cross-platform. CLR is so much better of a runtime than Java.
And CLR has some tools for packaging so the user doesn't need to have the CLR up front (their native compile stuff).
Interesting conversation, but have to eat. AFK.
veikko.eeva 3:19 PM
I wonder, by the way, if "Mingw binaries" are accepted to Windows Store? It might be important now that MS is able to get Win32 binaries running on this new core too.
The older Win32 binaries that is, using Drawbridge, which makes SQL Server to run on Linux too. Apparently without much of a hitch.
@micah.zoltu Yep, .NET Core looks superb and seems to be semi-available even on *BSD variety of systems.
And was it MIT licensed too, hmm...
@radix42 I don't know. I'm fairly sure it doesn't need to be a MS compiler, I think it depends on the linked libraries and APIs called.
Maybe I should ask somewhere.

zooko Electric Coin Company 11:21 AM
Hi, @ebfull! Thank you!
ebfull Electric Coin Company 11:24 AM
the language i would like to use on the security page is: "Clients on older versions of Zcash (in particular, <= 1.0.2) are at high risk of a blockchain fork or stalling event that could open them to double-spending attacks. Nodes are encouraged to update to the most recent version of Zcash, 1.0.5." or something of that sort..
ebfull Electric Coin Company 11:29 AM
Users that are still running older versions of Zcash (in particular, <= 1.0.3) are at high risk of a blockchain fork or stalling event that could open them up to double-spending attacks. All users and miners are encouraged to update their Zcash clients to the latest version and to reindex if they are experiencing problems. Most miners have updated to the most recent version of Zcash, and there is no evidence of a persistent chain fork affecting updated clients.

    February 10, 2017 - Dev update
    With the upcoming 1.0.6 release slated for Monday (Feb. 13th), a lot of the engineering effort this week was focused on final editing and reviewing of pull requests. Our Monday engineering meeting took a look at all remaining issues in the 1.0.6 milestone and confirmed whether addressing them was feasible for this release or should be pushed back to 1.0.7. To reiterate the 3 week release cycle process, last week’s triaging for the issues we would like to address in the upcoming release was done ...

The problem is Zcash is being hammered compared to other CryptoCurrencies & evan against fiat currencies, management should of had a map pathway well in advance of all the hype surrounding it pre-launch. I read all these messages by the Developers yet it appears Management has no Marketing plans, without any large scale Insitutional & commercial investors the price will continue to tumble, instead we have small trading volumes which is effecting liquidity without any support for Zcash.

yo
looks like one of the new releases broke z_sendmany for me
I wrote a script to do a z_sendmany and now it doesn't work at all, bombing out with an error parsing json error
Can anyone provide me with valid z_sendmany syntax that they've actually tried (not just copy/paste from the zcash user guide)
bedaxen 6:37 AM
UGH. I figured it out
The data value for the "amount" field needs a leading 0
So, you can't use .8
you need to use 0.8
veikko.eeva 6:38 AM
@bedaxen Care to share a valid message here? Just in case. 🙂
bedaxen 6:39 AM
it's working now
I'm not sure in which version this parsing behavior changed
it's simple to recreate
just take any z_sendmany transaction with a value of ZEC less than 1 and clip the leading 0 from the "amount" data field amount
veikko.eeva 6:40 AM
@bedaxen I was thinking if I need this at some point, I'd have a referene right here. Just in case there isn't one in the User Guide (I don't know, haven't looked into it that deeply).
bedaxen 6:40 AM
i.e. amount=0.8 to amount=.8
and it will error out with a JSON parsing error
If anything, I'd just put a note in the guide to tell people to format the amount field data string to have a leading 0 if the amount is less than 1 ZEC
The example in the guide does have a leading zero, so I guess it's covered
I got my clipped amount value from the linux "dc" command
I'll fix it
thanks
bedaxen 7:01 AM
printf to the rescue! LOL
printf "%0.8f\n" .8
0.80000000
it turns out that dc doesn't natively support leading zeroes in it's output
😞
bedaxen 7:21 AM
@veikko.eeva If you want to put something super useful in the guide, put that "error parsing JSON" error in it. The problem is: The error is so vague, you won't really know that you got the JSON syntax basically right, except for not having a leading 0 on the amount value. A person could go nuts with that, thinking they don't have the rest of the structure of the JSON block correct. Just sayin'... 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:30 AM
@bedaxen that was likely caused by our migration from JSON Spirit to UniValue in 1.0.6 (pulled in from Bitcoin), which will have tightened up JSON syntax parsing
bedaxen 7:32 AM
Either way, don't get me wrong... I'm not complaining

We require a client wallet with a Bitcoin-compatible RPC API, that can be compiled from source code (preferably on github or similar) and that will run under Debian 7
We may also currently ask for a contribution to hosting costs, as servers hosting the wallet daemons are our major source of expenses.
Currently, we prefer to host the daemon ourselves for reliability reason, both so we know what code the daemon is running and to ensure good uptime.

Preferred contact method is currently through bitcointalk.

Note that due to unclear BitLicense requirements, requesting an explorer is not possible for New York state residents or citizens. If you happen to live or be a New York state citizen, please contact the NY DFS for further inquiries.

what do you think of bitcoin segwit? zcash has any plan to merge segwit ? do you discuss segwit in zcash company ? zcash block size is 2M now.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 10:53 PM
My opinion is that segwit is very complicated for what it does
Much of that complexity is as a result of trying to implement it as a soft fork. We generally have a different perspective on the tradeoffs of hard vs soft forks to the Bitcoin Core devs
Also, it seems at the moment that segwit may not activate on the main Bitcoin chain, which reduces the attractiveness of being compatible with it.
lustro 10:56 PM
Different perspective as in more amenable to potential hard forks?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 10:57 PM
We've been looking at Flexible Transactions from Bitcoin Classic, and that seems like an attractive alternative to me, although we've not made any decision on that
lustro: yes

Another difference between Zcash and Bitcoin re: segwit is that in the Bitcoin community, support or otherwise for segwit has become conflated with the block size debate
In Zcash we think of them as entirely independent; the throughout limit of Zcash is 8 times that of Bitcoin at the moment, so there's no need to raise it for the time being
(and Zcash blocks are not full anyway)
dodger Electric Coin Company 8:31 AM
So, for us, SegWit is purely about non-malleability.

Not purely, it has some other functional benefits

@lustro I think the explorer is showing transactions incorrectly. Take this recent block: https://explorer.zcha.in/blocks/0000000070d4539c6c181d067a94ad97f8579271e96cb6247b54523f12c37ef6

    explorer.zcha.in
    Zchain - Zcash Block Explorer & API
    Zchain: Zcash Block Explorer, Analytics Platform & API. Browse and search blocks, transactions, accounts, statistics and more.

It's showing transparent input value for a coinbase tx. That shouldn't happen.
The output side is showing 12.5004 ZEC which is incorrect, it should be 12.5. ( you can confirm by examining the actual raw transaction )
If you click into into the transaction, the input side correctly shows No inputs, but the Output side still shows incorrect values.
lustro 11:42 AM
That looks like an issue, let me take a look
Hmm - the block page had a silly array bug - reload and it should be fixed
The TX output should be 12.5004 ZEC, though, shouldn't it? That block had 0.004 ZEC of miner fees.

How else are you examining output value?
@bitcartel
bitcartel 2:53 PM
Yep correct its the miners fee. Is it possible to break that out visually? There is the label 'Miner Reward' on the right hand side so that might confuse people into thinking the whole amount is the reward. Also the block page doesn't show the fees for the block (or I can't find it). It would be useful info to have.

Hi guys, is there a way to list all taddresses? e.g. if I've found 15 blocks then listtransactions would only show me the 10 last and if I want to send all amounts to a zaddr I have to do it by hand but I can only see the last 10
`zcash-cli listreceivedbyaddress 0 true` shows one address with 0 balance
crypt0biwan 1:45 AM
Thanks @radix42 👍
I'm gonna try it and let you know if it worked
To create the global ZADDR variable I should do `ZADDR="address"` right?
Don't know that export command
that's fine, don't want to do it by hand 😉
Ah nice
thanks
I know I can create a file with `touch send.sh`
but can I do it at once with the shell code you posted?
I know it's something with `>>send.sh` or something

Is it possible that a solution cannot be found from the instantiated data created by EquihashGen or will there always be 512 XOR blocks somewhere in the 200 bit data strings to reach the difficulty adjusted solution?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:10 AM
@edstewbob it is possible that a solution cannot be found. In that case, the mining code just increments the nonce and tries again.
Equihash only guarantees finding 2 solutions on average (actually closer to 1.9)
So sometimes a run will find zero solutions; sometimes it will find four or five.
edstewbob 10:14 AM
Each miner or pool operator automatically increments the nonce in this case if they have determined that a solution is not possible with the EquihashGen created data?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:38 AM
@edstewbob they do that anyway
The Equihash algorithm is only part of the PoW
Equihash could find six solutions, and yet none of them satisfy the difficulty
edstewbob 10:43 AM
Is there any ELI5 documentation that explains this in some detail? I know the protocol document is very detailed but hard for the non-expert to follow and some people like me who are new to zcash and it's implementation of block chain could benefit.

What's Samantha's credentials in the CryptoCurrency/Blockchain industry? Zcash does not need spokespeople, hearing the same rhetoric only makes people more cautious, Zcash needs to source, find & maintain relationships with Corporate/Insitututional/Government sectors to invest more in Zcash, prior to launching Zcash was assumed as having the most technical group of people with strong Govetnment backing , well if that was the case why are they not supporting them? Zcash needs a concrete plan & aggressively market the plan , you can have the most talented people, most technically advanced technologies, most disruptive technology yet if no one knows about it, the price will always reflect that.

anyway, I do value that and intend to continue working on it.
And, honestly, I think I'm okay at it,
but what we're *really* good at is engineering, infosec, cryptography, protocols, APIs, etc.
So almost all of the company's resources are focused on that kind of work, because that's what we're best at.

The Israeli _Ministry of Science, Technology, and Space_ awarded a research grant to my group at Tel Aviv University (essentially, sponsored student scholarships), to support development of novel methods for ensuring computational integrity, such as SNARKs. Zcash is a subsequent application of these methods, but this doesn't mean the Ministry endorses Zcash.

@zooko yes you are very good at being the Zcash spokesperson and your online information is excellent so please don't take this as criticism at all but there is very little out there for people to see and understand exactly what benefits Zcash provides especially in comparision to other crypto currencies. I'm sure the team including you are very focused on the technical integrity and improvements to the new system. I think it would eventually help if someone was focused on marketing and providing a public view especially on YouTube where there are zero Zcash videos and over a hundred for Dash as an example. There may not be resources available at this moment for such an endeavor but I just wanted to express my support for consideration in the future as Zcash grows over time.
edstewbob 9:02 PM
@crypto.world I agree that a good marketing plan is important for future growth but would leave it to the Zcash team to determine what they believe that focus should be. I'm sure they are up to their eyeballs right now in keeping the system running well. I still believe a more public profile and presence on YouTube would be of value not to basically criticize other currencies like Samantha tends to do but to explain the many benefits that Zcash has to offer.

@edstewbob I assume you're referring to *Amanda* Johnson wrt Dash marketing. She's been making YouTube videos for years... it's her shtick. And her partner, Pete, is just as involved with the operation (recording, editing, etc). It takes a lot of time & resources to maintain regular video production like they do and in my opinion, something like that is not the best use of Zcash resources. And to be honest, the Dash detailed videos I've seen have an awkward feel to them... the obvious bias contends with the podcast-y/community/news feel of Youtube videos. If you're going to do video/audio PR, you're better off waiting for interview inquiries from journalists who can ask potentially controversial/negative questions rather than making a series of heavily biased videos... more people will take you seriously. We have a small communications team covering developers, users and business/enterprise, but as Zooko mentioned, our overall strength is engineering and the Zcash ecosystem will benefit more if we stick to what we do best by improving the tech and making it easier for third-party integration than focusing too much on market-y stuff.

Of course, that doesn't mean a community based Zcash video series/podcast wouldn't benefit the ecosystem... but for ZECC, we're better off communicating with journalists for outreach and PR to keep things objective.

You should hire people to do it then because zec needs it . People really do not see and even more dont understand what it takes to do the tech-y stuff either. There is a balance in business and what will people benefit from if it is worth 5$ . All coins are created equal does not apply then. Take example if someone that invested in zec because he believed in you and saw you could make it happen .....but at the end you run out off funds because it wasnt market well.....even if you made only the people around that kitchen table on the stream day will care because people are savy and greedy they want the success and the money. @paige tech-y people are not marketers get some in your team.....the project as all it takes to make it.....but it is far from above any other coins and if coins are created equal the team as some catching up to do. I invested over 30k in zec and luckily i only lost 1k but i am expecting more.... branding and an image that reflect your tech-y stuff

We the Zcash community might know the team may be talented from a technical & engineering point of view, however how does Zcash differentiate from the hundreds of other CryptoCurrencies with all of them claiming to be experts in the field & you have several like Moneto, Dash, Zcoin all claiming & promoting privacy??? How can we measure Zcash teams expertise to fully distinguish themselves from the rest of the pack? If the price continues to spiral downwards you know why, it takes more than just technical engineering talent to be successful.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 4:56 AM
The price is not "spiraling downwards". In late December (around December 20) it was around $34, now it is around $30
The main reason why people perceive a greater price drop than that is the unrealistic prices before late December
Which were due to speculation (not by anyone associated with ZcashCo) and frankly should just be discounted

The price has definitely spiralled down, at one stage it was steady after the initial ridiculous price of 1 Zec -3300 BTC, Dec. price has fluctuated from $50-$70, $30-$50. & now $25-30. There has not been one steady upward trend, more importanty the trading volumes are so minimal compared to the other new CryptoCurrencies is a reflection of no interest, you & the other Developers can claim what you like , the reality is until the Markets-Industries/Cotporates /Governments [can understand the difference between Zcash & the rest it's going to be a struggle cause it appears Management have no interest for growth & solely focused on Development, reliant on third parties -if I'm a third party I'd like to know why Zcash is different from the hundreds of other CryptoCurrencies out there, cause the trading volumes proves there's no interest.

Hi. I am new here. I am plan to learn more about zcash. When I run a node, I met the problem: cannot find the cash network parameters in ~/.zcash-params. I ran the `zcash-fetch-params` and got sprout-proving.key.dl, but it still told me "can't the file". Any help? thank you
neuromancer 7:55 AM
@ele not an expert here but just a thought, your file should have the .key extension, not the .dl one - this hints an incomplete download

does anybody know when zcash will implement checks to see if no counterfeit coins are created?
paige Admin Moderator 4:56 PM
@erik.van.velzen the rate is 12.5 ZEC created per block which is ~150 seconds, you can check the new blocks on this handy explorer: https://explorer.zcha.in/

@penguin Serial numbers of private coins are checked as part of the conensus rules, so they cannot be double spent. I think you might be referring to an altcoin which recently had a counterfeiting problem because the serial numbers were not being tracked properly.

Hello
rocket.cat 11:02 PM
Well hello there, borja
borja 11:04 PM
Hi people
I've did a transaction this morning via ShapeShift from BTC to ZCASH, and 4 hour later same same
I've a zcash wallet in Jaxx
And donnot where, who to ask
Anybody can help?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:23 PM
what's your question, @borja?
borja 11:24 PM
It can be more than 4H a transaction?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:25 PM
what kind of transaction was it? using t-addresses only, or z-addresses?
borja 11:25 PM
from bitcoin to zcash
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:25 PM
right, but what type of destination Zcash address?
oh, Jaxx only supports t-addresses I think
borja 11:26 PM
Jaxx
I used more than once
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:27 PM
I don't know of any reason why such a transaction would take 4 hours to appear on the block chain
do you have a confirmation from ShapeShift that the transaction was sent?
borja 11:27 PM
Yes
I have it
The ShapeShift is now in progress
Stand by ...
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:27 PM
I would contact ShapeShift support
borja 11:28 PM
I'm also mining zcash and my address has changed at 13h
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:29 PM
either the transaction did get onto the block chain and there is a problem on the Jaxx side, in which case ShapeShift should be able to point to the transaction in an explorer....
or it didn't get mined, and then it's ShapeShift's responsibility
borja 11:31 PM
If I check my BTC there is a transaction ID but 0 confirmations
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:32 PM
oh, is it possible that the BTC didn't reach ShapeShift, then?
bitcartel 11:32 PM
Mempool, stuck transactions, backlog in Bitcoin past week
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:32 PM
yeah, that is very likely
well, I have to sleep. 'night everyone
borja 11:33 PM
So, what I have to do?
Just wait?
My zcash address changed
and will change again soon
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:34 PM
your wallet will still have the old address, I think
bitcartel 11:34 PM
@borja Yes, you have to wait for your Bitcoin transaction to be confirmed in the blockchain, before it reaches Shapeshift.
borja 11:34 PM
well, but the bitcoin dissapeared from wallet
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:35 PM
the wallet will mark the funds as having been sent, even though the transaction hasn't been mined
borja 11:35 PM
Ok
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:35 PM
how to resolve that is a Bitcoin issue rather than a Zcash issue
borja 11:36 PM
The second question is, about the address
what would happen if changed
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:37 PM
I'm a little confused as to what you mean by the address changing
are you solo mining, or mining via a pool?
borja 11:38 PM
via mining pool
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:38 PM
the behaviour of the solo miner is to generate a new address for each mined block...
ok, then it depends on the pool
bitcartel 11:39 PM
Which mining pool? Typically you just give them an address and your payout goes to that address.
borja 11:39 PM
My ZCash Address in jaxx has changed
Chinese one
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:39 PM
I haven't used the Jaxx wallet
borja 11:39 PM
flypool CN
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:40 PM
maybe contact Jaxx support and ask them what would cause that?
bitcartel 11:40 PM
Oh ok, so you've joined a mining pool, Flypool to mine BTC and then converting that BTC into ZEC via Shapeshift, sending the ZEC to an address generated by Jaxx wallet?
borja 11:40 PM
yes
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:40 PM
oh right
I thought you were mining Zcash directly
borja 11:41 PM
Correct
bitcartel 11:42 PM
Contact Jaxx support and just ask them to confirm that the wallet retains all keys for Zcash addresses it displays to the user. I'm pretty sure they would.

    👍 1 

borja 11:42 PM
Ok
Thanks for your support, I'll do that
I'll continue in this chat
I'm contacting same moment Jaxx, because I just think it is not normal more than 4h
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:44 PM
remember that if the delay is on the Bitcoin side, then Jaxx won't be able to solve that problem. (Unless you also sent the Bitcoin from the Jaxx wallet? But probably not even then.)
borja 11:45 PM
Thanks for your help @daira @bitcartel

penguin 8:06 PM
@bitcartel yes, the serial numbers of private coins may be checked. but is it being checked in a way that doesn't involve zero-knowledge proofs / other new cryptography found in zcash?
for example all other bitcoins and altcoins have a way of checking total unspent transaction outputs. is there an easy way to check that with zcash as well ( that doesn't depend on moon math ) ?
thekyriarchy 8:16 PM
@zooko who's the sysadmin for this? they can set the bridge up with that
i could also set up the oftc bridge in the meantime

@thekyriarchy: ask @mineZcash
@penguin: We have zero-knowledge proofs that each transaction in the blockchain is correct, and there's no reason to think that there is any way to forge proofs, defeat or circumvent the verifier, or otherwise defeat the integrity checks.

    ☑ 1 

penguin 5:38 PM
@zooko there's no way even for a very competent user to verify that these zero knowledge proofs work
I was initially planning on holding all the zcash mined, but its too risky without this. Chances are that somebody is already forging proofs and the price could be a lot higher otherwise
zooko Electric Coin Company 5:42 PM
It's a similar situation to other complex cryptosystems.
Probably fair to include Bitcoin in that category, too.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:42 PM
Or any modern computer chip.

zooko Electric Coin Company 5:42 PM
It's very hard for even a competent user to evaluate such a system, but we do rely on open source, science, the investigations of others, etc.
For example, we hired external security auditors before launch to double-check that our own internal security audits hadn't overlooked something.
Of course it is still possible that both the internal and external audits failed to catch a flaw, but there nothing risk-free in life.
penguin 5:59 PM
not really
a competent user can verify that bitcoin doesn't have forged proofs, but not with zcash
zooko Electric Coin Company 5:59 PM
Okay, I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree.
penguin 5:59 PM
and also you didnt pay the external security auditors tens of millions of dollars
so they have no incentive to report such bugs, when they can make that money themselves
zooko Electric Coin Company 5:59 PM
One of the Zcash scientists is writing a tutorial on zkSNARKs in order to make it easier for more people to understand the technology.
penguin 6:00 PM
doesn't mean they can verify it themselves, bitcoin is quite simple to verify
you would need a phd or 2 to be able to do the verification
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:00 PM
Okay. So we disagree. What else do you hope to accomplish by continuing the discussion?
penguin 6:01 PM
i just want to know where you stand
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:01 PM
Is there anything else I can answer about that for you?
penguin 6:02 PM
so you disagree with my assertion that bitcoin is easy for a user to verify the integrity of the system, whereas zcash would require years of study to verify it?
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:02 PM
Eh, "easy" and "years of study" are vague. I agree that Bitcoin is easier to understand than zkSNARKs, for sure.
But on the other hand Bitcoin is terribly hard to understand, and requires years of study to really thoroughly understand.
penguin 6:03 PM
"easy" let's say 1 week of cryptography study to verify on the theoretical level
to understand zcash, let's say 1 year of cryptography study
not on a theoretical level for bitcoin, maybe on a coding level
but zcash on a theoretical level would take at least 1 year of cryptography study, only a few very smart people really understand it
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:04 PM
I dunno. I think a little more on the bitcoin studying, but let's not quibble.
actually I think a lot more, like years, but whatever.

    ☑ 2 

penguin 6:05 PM
hm thats interesting
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:05 PM
Like, to verify the security of Bitcoin, you really ought to understand elliptic curve cryptography.

    ☑ 2 

That's hard! I've never been able to understand elliptic curve cryptography yet.
lustro 6:05 PM
IMO the vast majority (>99.99 percent) of crypto users essentially depend on trusting the developers
penguin 6:05 PM
yeah but thats been out for decades
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:05 PM
But this doesn't change your point that understanding Zcash is even harder,
penguin 6:05 PM
zk snarks hasn't
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:06 PM
because you have to understand elliptic curve cryptography, and then go on to understand several more even harder things.

    ☑ 1 

penguin 6:06 PM
but zk snarks isn't something that has been verified by more than a handful of people
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:08 PM
Um, again it's hard to ascribe specific numbers to these things. It's been published in the leading cryptography conferences, which is where crypto goes that gets studied by all the professors and researchers in cryptography around the world.
But maybe a lot of them didn't pay attention? Hard to tell.
It could be maybe 10,000 different researchers at the high estimate who have studied zk-SNARKs? Could be ... Maybe 100 at the low estimate?
One thing you can do is see how many other papers have been written by other people which analyze zk-SNARKs or propose new improved variants, etc.
penguin 6:09 PM
can you link me to a popular zk snark paper?
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:09 PM
Plus which there are the open source hackers, like Vitalik Buterin and others, who have been publishing blog posts analyzing the math, so we should count them too.
Let's see…
penguin 6:09 PM
vitalik buterin doesn't know anything about zk snarks lol
maybe at a high level yes
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:09 PM

@penguin Vitalik asked me to go over some of his posts on SNARKs.

@penguin I tend to agree that to fully understand and verifiy all the math behind Zcash - which is basically 3 layers that need to be understood - the Zcash protocol - zkSNARKs-Elliptic curve pairings - would take almost a year for someone with a math PhD (at least that's what it seems to be taking me ).
Indeed, there are professional mathematicians and computer scientists that dedicate their whole career to the ECC layer alone.
But it doesn't have to be all or nothing. Hopefully, simplified examples can make people more at ease that it is reasonable that such things exist and can work. That's the purpose of posts like this https://z.cash/blog/snark-explain.html.
Btw I'm not sure this situation is special for SNARKs in today's world. I don't know how most of tools I use in my everyday life really work - e.g. my laptop, car, ect.

@daira Quantitative easing doesn't really violate balance. Ever since the gold standard ended, monetary supply can expand whenever politically expedient. For the greater good or so it goes. Problem with the current ongoing financial crisis is that nobody seems to have figured out how to deflate a balance sheet full of junk assets (see chart): https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/WALCL

Hi everybody, for a few days I've read about ZCash and yesterday I've completed the installation of the ZCash system, following your instructions:

https://www.cryptocompare.com/mining/guides/how-to-mine-zcash-with-cpu-linux/.

I've posted the questions below on the forum and it was suggested to me to ask here.

Before starting to mine, I need to be sure of the following things:
1) On the step 3.4/5 (running ZCash) for the choose of username and password on the file zcash.conf

rpcuser=username
rpcpassword=password

are then opening a window where I have to insert username and password that I choose or are the username and password to be defined in this file? Example:
rpcuser = mickeymouse
rpcpassword =ILoveMinnie

Then save.

2) Once that I get the wallet address and the scriptpubkey, how can I sell an amount of ZCash to get euro/dollars/chf and so on?

Thanks in advance!

@auritianus with the latest version of Zcash, point 1) is no longer necessary (but you *do* need to at least create an empty zcash.conf to let zcashd know that you're happy with the default settings).
2) same way as any other cryptocurrency: find an exchange that supports the trade you want to make.

Answer to 1) I have already created the file. Sorry, but I don't understand what you mean with " to let zcashd know that you're happy with the default settings). " The zcash.conf is in any case created as shown in the webpage of my first post.

This is a great idea marketing wise the fact that the word cash is in the coin name will probably get twice the adoption then bitcoin or stuff like bitpay
Second step is to reach young people and get it viral....but know one in here are interested in ideas like that.....i assure you that funding would come from above....i was talking to people in the travel industry about zcash travel points and how it could work and they loved it...maybe you heard about Air Transat

    Folks: Ever since approximately release 1.0.4 or so (I don't remember exactly when), we've been following a regular schedule of putting out a new 1.0.x stable release every three weeks. The next release — 1.0.7 — is due out Monday, March 6. Here's the Milestone tracking this release. This will be Jay's first turn as Release Manager. 🙂 The changes in 1.0.7 include merging in improvements that upstream Bitcoin Core has made since Zcash MagicBean branched off of Bitcoin Core, plus a...

Whether it's French or not any publicity with proper marketing channels & systems is good, have you budgeted for marketing? Evan if you set up crowdfunding dedicated specifically for marketing the investment, support & exposure will grow exponentially. Relying on small speculators & mum & Dad traders who trade small parcels of Zcash isnt the answer, growth comes with large scale investment & support-Zcash needs to be heard by the finance, corporate,Industries to understand there's a more effective & efficient method of financial transactions & security. @zooko

    I think it is confusing because https://network.zcha.in is trying to include both "most recent 24-hour" counts and "all time" counts on the same display. @lustro: I'd suggest that you just remove the "all time" display (even though that makes the Zcash network look a lot smaller!), or move it to a separate page. I've heard multiple people being confused about this, including me in the past and including one of the Zcash dev team an hour ago. Anyway, @edstewbob, the number of nodes connected ...

the libsnark-facing code for Merkle paths is in src/zcash/circuit/merkle.tcc

yes
(I think all of it, but I haven't done an exhaustive check.)
some of the other code in src/zcash (e.g. Proof.cpp) does include libsnark headers, but I think that's mainly for encoding/decoding libsnark types

@zooko To be clear, looking for a way for a group of people from different locations to be able to check for incoming transactions and confirmations.
The easiest thing for me would be an online wallet, but I have not found any wallet that supports z-addresses.
Now I think about this scheme: remote linux box, zcashd and simple web interface. I want to get a 1) balance 2) 10 last transactions and the number of confirmations. Is it as simple as making 3 RPC calls? Seems like I should use both bitcoin and zcash payment APIs. Right? z_gettotalbalance for balance, z_listreceivedbyaddress for z-addr transactions and ListTransactions for t-addr transactions? Anything else I should know?

    I posted my concerns about Monero privacy tech on twitter: I'd encourage all Zcashers who talk about this issue, on twitter, here or where-ever, to demonstrate patience and "assuming the best of others". If you start to assume the worst of someone you're talking to, then just gracefully bow out of the conversation instead of accusing them. Let's show 'em that the Zcash community has a higher standard of discourse than other have.

BTW for others @here: the release glitch doesn't impact any user security, privacy, operation, or usage. It also has no impact (AFAIK) on users of the debian package, or users who install from the tarball.
The only impact is for users who build from source, and the work-around is to make sure you run `git fetch --tags` prior to `git checkout v1.0.7` as @radix42 pointed out. (Thanks!)

I'm loosing all the money on source addres when doing sendmany on testnet
What I am doing wrong?
Balance of tmRUQNq3mPLi6n31wEjUEHEpAWTQ35rfVhD is 100 TAZ
I'm doing POST on my node url with this body: {"method":"z_sendmany","params":["tmRUQNq3mPLi6n31wEjUEHEpAWTQ35rfVhD", [{"address":"ztnPZAd7rWF5WASvAeRqri82ngatGLFZdR7f8hVorj8Qg44JUF7jTnu3TwXSa6Ud1e8j6bDAiUarTu6iJR5f27tq9CZzkET","amount":0.0001}], 1, 0.0001]}
Now I see in my console:
user@zcash-testnet:~/zcash/src$ ./zcash-cli z_getbalance ztnPZAd7rWF5WASvAeRqri82ngatGLFZdR7f8hVorj8Qg44JUF7jTnu3TwXSa6Ud1e8j6bDAiUarTu6iJR5f27tq9CZzkET

I'm pretty sure on my real node(mainnet) is everything is ok
I'm developing api, switched to testnet3 and just don't get what the

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:48 PM
yes, if you make sure that the transaction balances exactly then no change will be sent
_checks the API docs_
zcasher-17 1:49 PM
The problem getnewaddress sometimes generate my change address
z_getnewaddress too
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:49 PM
so, addresses are preallocated, but that's supposed to be just an optimization
zcasher-17 1:49 PM
*getnewaddress
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:49 PM
That's a Bitcoin-inherited issue
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:49 PM
huh
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:49 PM
`z_getnewaddress` should *never* generate an address you have used for change
Because there is no pre-allocation; it is always fresh
zcasher-17 1:50 PM
i expereinced that not one time
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:50 PM
that sounds like a bug to me
zcasher-17 1:51 PM
when i did z_getnewaddress, it returned me non-zero adress
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:51 PM
`getnewaddress` should not be returning an address that has already been used
zcasher-17 1:51 PM
It is very old bug
Yes, but it may return address with balance
Change address, i suppose
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:51 PM
it should not (either `getnewaddress` or `z_getnewaddress`)
zcasher-17 1:51 PM
The proof over there
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:51 PM
Okay, we are talking cross-purposes here
Let's talk about one thing at a time

    👍 1 

First: `z_getnewaddress` (for generating new z-addrs)
I'm looking at the code for that, and it directly calls `SpendingKey::random()`, and then checks for a collision.
So there is no way it could return an address that was already used.

    ☑ 1 

(if it did happen to generate an address already present in the wallet, it would error)
zcasher-17 1:53 PM
hmm
maybe on T addresses then
maybe i'm wrong
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:53 PM
So second: `getnewaddress` (for generating new t-addrs)
Now *here* I wouldn't be surprised if you did receive an address that had previously been used for change.
zcasher-17 1:55 PM
So solution is to watch up the addresses manually(getting list of addresses and checking them getrecevied)?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:55 PM
_looks at the code_
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:55 PM
`getnewaddress` tries calling `ReserveKeyFromKeyPool` first, and if that fails (the keypool is empty) it generates a new random key.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:57 PM
right, but when a pool address is used for change, that should remove it from the pool, no?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:58 PM
When creating a new transaction, if a change address isn't specified, `CWallet::CreateTransaction` calls `CReserveKey::GetReservedKey`
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:58 PM
I was under the (possibly mistaken) impression that the pool was only supposed to contain as-yet unused addresses
if not then that's horrible, and we should fix it
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:58 PM
which calls `ReserveKeyFromKeyPool`
So in theory, `ReserveKeyFromKeyPool` should ensure that it returns addresses only once.

Zooko ever considered explaining in "Plain English" or translating into other languages what the point of difference is betwe Zcash & the hordes of hundreds of other CryptoCurrencies? The selling point shouldn't criticise others as Digital Cash does with Zcash, you should promote why Zcash is the best form of anonymity, security, privacy, one of the reasons I'm heavily invested in Zcash is i thought they had the most high tech breakthrough in FinTech with the smartest most technically advanced Engineering/Technology minds in the world, that may be the case but if no one understands or knows about this advancement then Zcash will continually struggle to be accepted in mainstream society.

I think we might want to do some tweaking if we want a good handle on shielded address usage, though - separating coinbase transactions and the required coinbase shielding transactions, maybe

Hi everyone I am Brand New here and I am only interested in buying a little bit just for the heck of it as a investment only. I do not want to "mine" at all. Am I able to Buy like just 10 ZEC and put them in one of these "wallets" and then just leave it there without it causing me any fees at all? I have No bitcoins or any cryptocurrencies at all and I am probably looking very stupid to all of you but I am wanting to start somewhere. I live in rural interior Alaska and live a subsistence lifestyle off the land harvesting my own meats and also garden.

I do Not have much money at all and seeing how this Bitcoin thing has done I thought what the heck I would ask someone somewhere, here I am trying, and see how a "cheechako" (rookie in Alaskan language) goes about buying 10 of these ZEC`s. Would someone be willing to lead me in the right direction to where I need to be? Like I said I just want to purchase some in USD, my debit card, and then just check the prices like i do my Gold and Silver and IF it goes up in value alot maybe sell it at that time.

I know I am most likely going to lose my rearend being stupid like this or possibly in a long shot maybe make some money. I am willing to risk a little money just to get in this now. I also am somewhat understanding I would have to first buy let`s say 400.00 in Bitcoin and then turn around and buy 400.00 worth of ZEC is that Correct? I am going to watch what I can on Youtube to try and figure some of this out on my own but I would very much appreciate any Help if someone could possibly help me out here. Please see I am Honest here which you can do by checking out any of my Alaskan videos I have on Youtube now just do a search there for "Cory Martin Alaska" and it should bring my videos up or Please look at my Facebook Group "Alone in Alaska Adventures".

I apologize if this is not allowed in here and also thank you in advance for any help you could give me on these questions. I do not feel comfortable buying a bitcoin for an investment due to the high price and with the price of ZEC being alot more reasonable and cheaper plus from what I have read the way all information can be hidden from public that appeals to me. Thank You for your time.

@cory.martin You are right in that you would have to buy bitcoin first, then buy zcash with the bitcoin
you dont have to buy a whole bitcoin as its divisible by 8 places (Like the us dollar with 2 decimal places $1.34)
if you want to buy $400 worth of bitcoin, it would be 0.39726 btc
zcash is the same way

It's not true that you have to buy Bitcoin first and then buy Zcash with the Bitcoin.

@cory.martin, since you are in USA, you are starting with USD. You can either use the USD to buy Bitcoin and then use the Bitcoin to buy Zcash, or you can sign up for one of the two exchanges on which you can exchange USD directly for ZEC. Those two are Kraken and Bitfinex.

    @weirdnik Can you bring this up in https://t.co/63sF86rF7z #zcash-dev channel? Accounts are depreciated but would be good to hear your view.

weirdnik 8:23 AM
I just wanted to say that removing account features makes it much harder to implement ZEC payments, with bitcoin I have accounts named for every user and an API to check how much a given user paid.
With account depreciation in ZCash I have to reimplement this all within the app and only for Zcash.
bitcartel 11:01 AM
@weirdnik Upstream Bitcoin has deprecated accounts too, so this is a model you'll have to move to eventually.
weirdnik 11:12 AM
as I understand bitcoin core moves to label scheme, which may be enough for my uses (need to investigate), but there is no labels
there are no labels for Zcash
zscamfe 11:45 AM

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:43 PM
It's quite possible that we'll add a feature to help with this use case, either corresponding to a Bitcoin feature or not
however, accounts were a poor abstraction. they interacted badly with change and did not enforce that account balances were nonnegative
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:50 PM
@weirdnik one thing we *have* decided on is thinking of addresses as money buckets, so once we make the appropriate change to t-addrs (so change is sent back to them instead of to a new address), then you can use one address per user.
Labels to group addresses is a nice idea though, and something we don't have for z-addrs
(but should do for t-addrs, although IDK if we are missing RPCs that upstream have added since 0.12 to make their use easier)

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:42 PM
Correct: the proving and verifying keys are public - everyone has the same ones. The public/private keys for spending etc. are per-note or per-address, and are completely independent of the public proving and verifying keys
(except that they need to conform to a specific format and usage, which is what the proving and verifying keys are enforcing)
zenosama 5:07 PM
Hi guys, i have a question, if Ethereum adds zsnarks, why would people still use zcash? Is there still advantages to use zcash instead of ethereum?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:22 PM
@zenosama if Ethereum adds zk-SNARKS, that will only be at the upper token layer; the ETH below it will still be public, which means there is still information that could be leaked about the transaction graph.
(although it is more indirect than in the case of Bitcoin's transaction graph, but I don't have a good feel for how safe those kinds of indirections are in practice)
Point is, Zcash would still be useful, because we are focused on having as little publicly-visible information in the blockchain as is scientifically possible.
I won't get into arguments over which is "better" though, as that entirely depends on your use case 🙂
zenosama 5:29 PM

Im pretty excited about this project.

Thanks, @str4d. I'm thinking about trying to make a shim that goes ontop of bitcore-lib instead of using the fork of bitcore-lib. Do you think this would be possible/hard? Besides the changes in lib/network and the joinsplit code, I'm trying to understand the changes in blockheader (https://github.com/str4d/bitcore-lib-zcash/commit/8740d9e964e106aa14132cbeaf6d2e03f04e86ba) and address (https://github.com/str4d/bitcore-lib-zcash/commit/ebb8b5683aaa1276c4551116a9ca0af8557fa773) ... there's not too much code there but it seems to be pretty baked in. For instance, could this be done with the network definition instead of changing the code in address.js?

```
-  var pubkeyhashNetwork = Networks.get(buffer[0], 'pubkeyhash');
-  var scripthashNetwork = Networks.get(buffer[0], 'scripthash');

@skyl You should use different data/wallet directories for testnet and for mainnet; if you run with a data/wallet directory that was previously used on the other network then I'm not sure what happens, but data loss could be possible
But there's no need to recompile or reinstall zcash when switching (or running them in parallel)

@daira: I think Ubuntu is a well-supported platform, unlike Debian. And I think we should _not_ support MagicBean on Debian unless there is a good reason to do so, because that will detract from our bandwidth to accomplish more important goals.
weirdnik 3:05 PM
@zooko re: addresses as money buckets, might be but still makes ZCash a non-drop-in replacement for BTC code-wise and this demotes Cash support from "TODO" to "nice to have in the future"
also dropping debian support implies that the intended user is desktop linux user, debian carries much less overhead for server use

    👍 2 

and again it makes ZCash a special needs kid, I use Debian on all my servers and I would need to count in one special VM for that
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:10 PM
The only thing causing us issues on Debian right now is the AMQP code. I'd rather support Debian and say that AMQP doesn't work on it, than drop Debian entirely (because it's otherwise been low-cost to have both Debian and Ubuntu)

    👍 1 ☑ 1 

Of course, that would mean having separate .deb packages for Debian and Ubuntu (so Ubuntu can have AMQP compiled in), but that shouldn't be too much overhead, particularly if we get that part automated.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:13 PM
@zooko: several devs use Debian. not supporting it would slow us down as well
we absolutely need to be able to compile both on Debian and Ubuntu

The AMQP code does work on Debian. @daira built it with gcc 5.3 on Debian. The problem is our CI environment.

@weirdnik: using "special needs kid" to describe something you don't like about a piece of software carries ableist implications, please don't do that
weirdnik 3:23 PM
OK, sorry, anyway my point is that limiting software availability to one special case, not even architecture (like linux/amd64) is a very weird and limiting move when you want to get traction and make ZCash popular.

same goes for diverging from bitcoin RPC api, when I got interested in ZCash for the project I assumed that I just can drop zcashd next to bitcoind with no extra code needed
outragedhuman 3:32 PM
Wouldn't clinging to the BTC RPC be limiting in itself? Or do you mean retain all current BTC RPC functionality but expand from there?
(admittedly I think I missed the start of this conversation, I just joined)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:33 PM
It was never going to be possible to stay inside the BTC RPC - shielded transactions are sufficiently different that a new design was necessary
weirdnik 3:34 PM
I get that there's need for extra APIs for the new features, of course.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:34 PM
The intention was that the existing RPCs enabled faster uptake for transparent-only transactions, and then newer RPCs would enable usage of both transparent and shielded transactions
That inherently requires treating transparent and shielded transactions in a similar way (namely the "addresses as buckets" mentality)
Your suggestion of labels is a useful one though, and it's something that should still be doable without falling into the issues that accounts had
weirdnik 3:37 PM
I get it. it is just on my deploy the APIs that work for BTC but are deprecated don't work on ZEC anymore at all. And BTC moves to labels but ZEC does not -> two different APIs for BTC and ZEC -> extra work -> ZEC gets deprioritized
outragedhuman 3:38 PM
Ooo, I do like the idea of labels. That would make CLI accounting much easier.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:38 PM
We do have labels for t-addrs; AFAIR that was present in 0.11.2
But maybe they have RPC changes to make them easier to use? @weirdnik what RPC would you be using for BTC's label support?
outragedhuman 3:38 PM
Sounds like I need to update my mining crons then.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:39 PM
_is the lead for porting PRs from Bitcoin_
weirdnik 3:40 PM
I didn't research moving to labels yet. What I currently use is getaccountname(some name) to get address associated with customer user name for the user to send payment to and getreceivedbyaccount which tells me how much the user paid, that's all.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:44 PM
Mmm. For Zcash's addresses-as-buckets view, using the current RPCs, you'd need to store the address instead of the account name, and then `getreceivedbyaddress t-addr` or `z_listreceivedbyaddress z-addr`
_looks at the label RPCs_
weirdnik 3:44 PM
the beauty of accounts is that I don't need to store anything app-side, bitcoind keeps track of what I need 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:46 PM
Okay, 0.11.2 had support for adding labels to imported keys, but not to generated keys

@zooko re: addresses as money buckets, might be but still makes ZCash a non-drop-in replacement for BTC code-wise and this demotes Cash support from "TODO" to "nice to have in the future"
zooko Electric Coin Company 6:37 PM
@weirdnik: however, as far as I can tell, the "Zcash addresses as money buckets" API is simpler and better than either the "accounts" API or the "labels" API.
So hopefully eventually people will want to use Zcash enough that they'll be willing to support an additional API.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:39 PM
@zooko labels can still help here, because then it's possible to have a 1:1 between some existing per-user label in their system, and a Zcash address.
anarch3 6:40 PM
People would still use labels for addresses, it's just not as a native RPC command
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:40 PM
So there's a usability benefit for users of multiple cryptocurrencies, where the system knows about the different RPCs, but internally only has to store a single label for all of them.
(rather than storing up to N different addresses per user)
zooko Electric Coin Company 7:03 PM
https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=PP7gp6iZf7jAihYQp — I'm skeptical that the zcashd API is a good place for that mapping to be stored/managed.

So if you are sending zcash with a protected transaction can there be multiple recipients in multiple JoinSplits? Is that how it works? And, if so, do the recipients of each fraction of the spend get to know what the other parts are? or is each JoinSplit encrypted with a different key?

Does anyone have an explanation for ZCash price crashing so badly after it was launched? Was it because the investors that invested around 5 mio $ in ZCash wanted to start cashing out early with that 20% founder reward?
zooko Electric Coin Company 10:16 AM
Hi smreko.
Paige, do we have this one in the FAQ yet?
anarch3 10:23 AM
@smreko it was because of the slow start
coins were rapidly inflating at the start to prevent a instamine
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:13 PM
I don't think it's as simple as lack of supply. I think it's that the prices being quoted (*very* briefly) by exchanges were not genuine prices
If you're selling to yourself then you can do so at any price. Therefore, in a situation where there isn't enough volume for people to know the price accurately, there may be an incentive to sell to yourself at an inflated price in order to convince others that the price is high
This I think is the ~only plausible~ most likely explanation for the sale at BTC 3199, which is what causes all the exchanges to show ZEC's price as having fallen so precipitously. They should exclude such price outliers from their graphs.
zooko Electric Coin Company 12:18 PM
That's speculation on your part.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:18 PM
It is, yes
But it is a serious vulnerability in the way exchanges report prices
No single sale should be able to have such a large effect on the scale of the graph used to show price fluctuations for the indefinite future
In any case, it can be ruled out that any Founders' Reward coins were involved in early price fluctuations
zooko Electric Coin Company 12:24 PM
@paige: how do I update the FAQ?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:25 PM
There's public evidence on the blockchain that the first spends of Founders' Rewards were much later

Thank you daira, that was really helpful!
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:55 PM
before launch, it was possible to derive a rough order-of-magnitude expected price from the amount that investors paid, which came out to USD 15.24 per ZEC (https://z.cash/blog/continued-funding-and-transparency.html). Note that this doesn't take into account the risk that investors were taking (which would cause the estimated price to be lower), or the fact that they were also investing in a share of the Zcash company (which would cause the estimated price to be higher)

the current price is entirely consistent with that estimate, and also with the price at which ZEC futures were traded on Bitmex

A99: The Zcash Founders did not receive any of their Zcash coins until December 21, 2016 (https://explorer.zcha.in/transactions/231c92d871f0578a5537fb949fc5cf9fd27f125fac4afb9e251b46d3d077e206).

@zooko you answered the second question only... and I'm not sure that's a FAQ. I would think it's better to just highlight the common question "Why was $ZEC so high at launch and why did it crash so bad?"
zooko Electric Coin Company 1:32 PM
A99 sentence two: At the beginning of the Zcash blockchain (starting October 28, 2016), there was an extremely limited supply of Zcash coins in existence, as described here: https://z.cash/blog/slow-start-and-mining-ecosystem.html For example, on October 29, 2016 the total Zcash coins in existence was 450 ZEC. On October 31, 2016, the total was 1950 ZEC.

A99 sentence zero: Nobody can tell why buyers and sellers agree to the prices that they do (aside from the buyers and sellers themselves, and even they each know only their _own_ thoughts — not anybody else's), but two things we can say: 1. It was _not_ due to the Founders' Reward coins being sold, and 2. It _might_ have had to do with the limited supply of Zcash coins in existence at that time.

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:53 PM
I think it would be potentially misleading to imply that that's the primary explanation
The issue here is how prices should be reported when volumes are low
It can be really misleading to just pretend that there is a single price in that situation
(There isn't even a single price in the normal case, but the spread of prices is typically small enough that the fiction that there is a single price almost works for some purposes.)
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:04 PM
In hindsight, we were possibly too focused on preventing initial fast-mining (which we successfully did with the slow start), and not enough on avoiding initial price volatility. Mind you, there wasn't actually much we could have done to *prevent* the latter; it didn't help that exchanges listed ZEC right from the first day, which I wasn't expecting
If I were advising on a new PoW-based cryptocurrency launch, I'd strongly advise to have an initial period of *zero* block rewards, in order to separate technical issues of mining ecosystem and difficulty adjustment as far as possible from the launch of the currency as an asset subject to speculation

Does it make sense to talk about "limited supply", for an asset that is (essentially) infinitely-divisible and also doesn't have any indivisible fundamentals?
It seems to me that what's special about slow-start is not "limited supply" but "high inflation".
Which makes high prices even weirder.
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:15 PM
I think one of the reasons for the insane prices at the launch was because many did not know/understand the slow start. Extremely limited supply plus high anticipation, and nearly _every_ exchange listing on day one (which in itself is unusual for an Alt coin) caused hyperinflation.

Did all the 1.0.8 nodes fall off the mainnet more than an hour ago?
lustro 11:41 PM
Mine's still running fine; probably just that none of them have pinged the network server in the past hour
zooko Electric Coin Company 11:41 PM
Oh, they don't normally ping more often than once per hour?
lustro 11:44 PM
I count as a "ping" (send version message to node) whatever is sent from mainnet.z.cash, which is a default peer I believe
So presumably whenever the daemon is started, and then periodically afterwards - that's dependent on networking code, I'm not sure there's a specific interval

Hey guys, just recently joined 🙂 I am doing a thesis on blockchain privacy and would like to know if it is possible to create a zcash testnet local to my machine with instant mining. Thanks, Tadhg
I understand zcash.conf can be set to a testnet but im unsure how to proceed
ebfull Electric Coin Company 11:21 AM
i recommend looking at `regtest` mode
i.e. `regtest=1` in your config file, and then you can use `zcash-cli generate` to generate blocks (which mine to you, coin maturity is 100 blocks so you have to mine enough that you can spend coins and play around)
by the way, welcome!

@Quent17 Our current status is Bitcoin but if Ethereum community moves faster, things could quite possibly change. 🙂 We want both asap!
Quent17 9:58 AM
Nice. Seems super interesting, following closely!
micah.zoltu 10:43 AM
I believe XCAT to Ethereum is fully within the control of anyone as you can just write a smart contract for the Ethereum half.
Bitcoin requires a BIP to go through and clients to be updated, so it is held up by the velocity of the Bitcoin maintainers.
Quent17 11:03 AM
Any chance for BIP199 to be integrated into Bitcoin Core 0.15 ?
dodger Electric Coin Company 11:32 AM
@micah.zoltu: My understanding is that a Blake2 precompile needs to be added to Ethereum to make it XCAT with Zcash practical.
micah.zoltu 11:34 AM
@dodger I believe that is only necessary for BTCRelay style cross-chain swaps.
XCAT is a different technique that does not require processing ZCash blocks on Ethereum.

Hi guys. I have a few questions regarding the tech of zcash and the long run
Do you know If zk snarks and other techniques used in zcash will still be considered anonymous even after quantom computers are prevelant?
veikko.eeva 3:51 AM
@zcomy From a layman perspective there are multiple angles to look at this from. One, for instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_signature_scheme, which, _I think_, should be considered in conjunction to this. I would welcome a well-rounded blog post or pointers if anyone has the time. 🙂
I have been lately thinking about using the memo field to point to files elsewher and how the contents could be selectively revealed to other parties, a bit like the viewing keys in ZCash and would they both benefit from something like attribute-based-encryption. It looks to me there is a real benefit in ZCash as a information sharing and coordination platform where one offloads the data to somewhere else, either availably in public (encrypted and authenticated) or in private (perhaps encrypted and authenticated). Maybe I should go deeper into thinking that how exactly could the offloaded data in its part affect the coordination in the blockchain level.

@zcomy The current snarks used by zcash will preserve privacy against quantum computers, but quantum computers will be able to forge money when using the current snarks. It is not clear how efficient quantum resistant snarks can be in the sense of non-forgeability

@arielg That's not quite right (about privacy being preserved), because the Curve25519 encryption can be broken by a sufficiently large practical quantum computer

Privacy is preserved for destination addresses that are kept as shared secrets between sender and recipient, though, because those don't depend on security of the Curve25519 encryption

arielg 1:26 PM
Yeah to clarify for @zcomy the privacy from snarks will be preserved but some privacy in Zcash is guaranteed by public key encryption and not snarks and that will be broken by quantum computers

What do you​ think about coming up with a good metric for "user transaction volume" - what I mean is tx volume excluding mining pool shielding and payouts.
zooko Electric Coin Company 8:14 PM
Oh, that _is_ a good idea. I think
_thinks_
lustro 8:14 PM
Yup, planning to integrate znodes as soon as @radix42 thinks it's ready.
zooko Electric Coin Company 8:14 PM
Yeah that seems simple and more accurate.
For now I can approximately it by subtracting 2 txns per block, right ?
lustro 8:17 PM
Well, maybe. I think pools vary a lot in payout frequency (not always once per block, not always in one transaction - manual payouts are probably not easy to detect, but the automatic ones might be)
The transactions shielding coinbase ZEC can always be identified
Payout detection would need to be a heuristic I think
zooko Electric Coin Company 8:23 PM
Hm.
Maybe mining payouts should not be excluded from the count.
lustro 8:29 PM
Yeah, that might just be confusing
Another count that would be useful might be "fully shielded" transactions (z-addr to z-addr)
Which shouldnt include many mining-related transactions as most pools pay to t-addrs
zooko Electric Coin Company 8:31 PM
Yeah, "fully shielded" would definitely be good to count!

mineZcash Admin Owner 12:26 PM
That's an impossible question to answer, as more people learn about Zcash and crypto-currency the more vendor's will start accepting payment in crypto-currencies
It took years for Bitcoin to be so widely accepted, and I would say it's not even _that_ widely adopted yet. I still have to explain what a crypto-currency is to 99% of the average people I meet 😄
And even then, they don't believe me with my "magic internet money" 🙃
smreko 12:32 PM
Yea, you are right .. so it will happen spontaneously when it happens. Probably when the bigger businesses realize its potential.
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:34 PM
Actually I think it will happen sooner than with Bitcoin. As more people begin to accept Bitcoin, they will become increasingly aware of it's lack of financial privacy and start looking for a solution like Zcash provides.
smreko 12:42 PM
Yea, but I don't see a problem with financial privacy for individuals .. you can change the addresses the whole time. But for companies this is essential yes. So I think Zcash will become used when companies realize .. I don't think most of bitcoin users have a problem with financial privacy, and even if they do it is solvable with bitcoin already.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:00 PM
If you are _very careful_ with how you use Bitcoin you can make it _more difficult_ to trace you but the methods are far from turn-key. Not to mention as Bitcoin popularity increases there are companies developing sophisticated programs dedicated to tracing bitcoin users, like this one I wrote about last year https://minezcash.com/coinlab-blows-lid-off-bitcoin/

Thank you for your good answers. Since Zcash is run as a company, is it possible that a government bans that company? And, would Zcash still be there if the government prohibited its development (like bitcoin, that no one can shut down, because it is mined everywhere across the world)? I would also like to know whether it is possible for Bitcoin to adopt the advantages of Zcash once in the future - and in that case, do you think Zcash would still survive as a way of payment?

@smreko: (a) I have received no indication that any part of the government of Colorado or USA has any problem with our company. We sometimes give talks and workshops to regulators, policy experts, central banks, etc. from various governments about how zero-knowledge can be used in blockchain technologies. (b) If the Zcash company were to shut down, turn evil, or pivot away from Zcash, then Zcash would be in the exact same position as Bitcoin is now — a world-wide open source project. (c) Eh, whatever, I'm tired of trying to predict the far future. Make your own predictions. I'm busy trying to create the near future. ☺
Oh, and among the other groups that we sometimes teach about this technology, including USA and Canadian law enforcement.

lotteries are already regulated in many countries (quite heavily so in some). that wasn't my point; my point was that in practice they are regressive in their effect on wealth distribution, and that is a reason to disfavour them as a matter of economic policy. Whereas what actually happens is that governments promote them, precisely because national or state lotteries function as a tax without the unpopularity

The z_validateaddress command says it is valid, but the sendtoaddress command returns error code -5 and says it is invalid.

I've been able to send real coins on the mainnet, so I have some basic understanding of the zcasd-cli, but I wonder if there is something fundamental I misunderstood about the testnet.

HI folks, wanted to talk about increasing your volume and distribution. We are a philanthropic brokerage that wants to correct to your price an index comprised of unfulfilled requests for research resources, potentially big ticket items that can drive profit for brokerages who trade zcash. We ourselves are looking to be listed next to your price so if a brokerage lists you they can list us. Essentially we correct to you, listing brokerages send us investors principals, we send them market data, and they confirm investor positions on your coin. We use the principal to fulfill the request and brokerages realize gains from your coin. It’s a better measurement of supply and increases adoption without merchants needing to accept them.

I'm intending to invest money in zcash not because I need huge return not because I want to make money but because I need a trustworthy reliable and credible company where i can deposit my money and it back. Where i can also get the company involved in fair business for example if an investor has a problem they must respond.
I have lost a lot of money in online business taking that high risks facing that online hackers. That is why I am strongly making such comments

[OFTC/bsm117532] @rocket.cat Bot 9:09 AM

[OFTC/bsm117532] @rocket.cat Bot 9:18 AM
In order that any given message not be de-anonymizable by timing, every other node in the network has to receive a message within a time window T that it was delivered to its actual recipient.
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 11:20 AM
bsm117532: i think that is not entirely correct. think long thin pipes not long fat pipes. notoriously hard to tune for reliability.

they explore a different set of tradeoffs; legit traffic vs decoy traffic vs latency
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 11:23 AM
in certain situations they can achieve near low latency of several seconds for entire mixnet route traversal if there is enough decoy traffic
[OFTC/bsm117532] @rocket.cat Bot 11:24 AM
dawuud: I just mean that your anonymity set is the set of people who have received a message within time T, so 1/T is your latency. You can't get around that...
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 11:24 AM
this of course would be a show stopper for mobile phones.
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 11:24 AM

[OFTC/bsm117532] @rocket.cat Bot 11:24 AM
dawuud: Not really...A mobile phone can wake up every ~minute, send a few bytes, and go back to sleep. But your latency is then a ~minute.

[OFTC/bsm117532] @rocket.cat Bot 11:32 AM
The timing parameters I've been thinking of revolve around the human response time of finding your phone, reading a request, and approving/denying it (which is sending a signature), and that's ~10s or so. By twiddling probability distributions of the junk traffic, you can hide other traffic inside this.

To receive Bitcoin you need bitcoind, you can't use zcashd, right?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:35 PM
zcashd is not compatible with bitcoin. You will have to set up a bitcoin wallet to receive bitcoin

Hi! It seems my node fails to add transactions to mempool with joinsplit-requirements-not-met error, this is a vanilla build. Can it be because of low RAM? thanks!

there are a bunch of things that can cause those to happen, and they are fairly frequent on ALL nodes, so unless one of YOUR transactions is failing, ignore those (you might be getting a block later than someone who spent a note right after getting it, tons of stuff like that)

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:46 AM
I think those are mainly due to JoinSplit invalidation caused by choosing too-recent anchors
https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1614

    choose less recent JoinSplit anchors · Issue #1614 · zcash/zcash

is zcash not stable or something to be used as currency yet? whats delaying adoption? development work?
i read the blog but sadly i do not understand it on a tech standpoint. i get that developments are active and you guys are working on groundbreaking/revolutionary stuff but whats stopping its growth path. just slow adoption by attrition or are there still tech issues needing to be worked out that people cant trust yet?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:14 PM
@papou you can see the development milestones here https://github.com/zcash/zcash/milestones

    github.com

    zcash

The protocol is sound, and privacy is the best you will find of any coin. One of the things delaying faster adoption are light wallets, and more vendors need to start accepting Zcash, so web integrations like WordPress and Woo commerce would be a great boost.

The block time is 2.5min, and I believe the block size is 2MB

The good thing about Zcash being a company is that it is trivial to make improvements like block size, segwit, etc..if needed without getting bogged down in poltics

This is basically a geek/techie dev channel, so the answers people are giving you are about tech development, but I think you are right to ask, because actually the current protocol, even before any upgrades, is good enough for people to use and what we need to is to get more merchants and more customers using it ASAP.

the community plays a big role in a project of course, all the work shouldnt be left to the team
market is growing nicely and price stability though
how many transactions per second can the blockchain handle?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:44 PM
For an average transaction size of 2000 bytes (JoinSplits are at least 1.5 kB IIRC, larger for more than two inputs or outputs), that's 6.67 tx/s for the targeted block interval of 150s.
Would be much higher for transparent transactions (26.67 tx/s for average tx size of 500 bytes), but we should be thinking in terms of shielded transactions, since that's our thing 😄
papou 7:47 PM
this doesnt compare well against bitcoin does it?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:47 PM
It depends on what you are comparing.
papou 7:48 PM
wouldnt scalability be an issue?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:49 PM
If you're comparing to the 7 tx/s that is often mentioned for Bitcoin, remember that both that value and my estimate above are completely arbitrary (mine even more-so, as I am using ballpark figures)
papou 7:49 PM
well ofc due to block size
how will ZEC handle scaling?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:58 PM
I can't speak for anyone else, but I hope by working on solutions to scaling problems as they arise. Currently that means making our shielded transactions faster, because that's the real scaling limiter at the moment.

    👍 2 

I look forward to block capacity being an actual problem for ZEC 🙂

@str4d is joinsplit what you call all shielded transactions? I thought snark proofs were 228 bytes and then the memo field was 512 making a txn size of 740 bytes? 😬 What's all the other info?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:44 PM
A JoinSplit is the technical name for the info inside a shielded transaction
It contains:
- 2 nullifiers for the input notes (32 bytes each)
- 2 MACs for the input notes (32 bytes each)
- 2 commitments for the output notes (32 bytes each)
- 2 ciphertexts for the output notes (1 + 32 + 4 + 32 + 512 + ~16 bytes each IIRC)
- 2 transparent values for shielding or unshielding ZEC (4 bytes each)
- The proof (288 bytes)
- Two other per- JoinSplit values (32 bytes each)
And then there is an extra 96 bytes in a shielded transaction that has one or more JoinSplits
(just woke up, so might have missed something)
rm 2:53 PM
Thanks! So nullifiers to prevent double spending? MACs to mitigate against adversarial..curcuit execution? Commitments.. so the guy you're sending to can prove he actually received money at some point? Ciphertexts for sending love letters ❤️! What are the 96 extra bytes for?
(Feel free to direct me to a blog post if I'm being obtuse! Also good morning! Also thanks again!)

@rm basically (the MACs ensure integrity of some part that I forget). The commitments anchor newly-created notes into reality (they are used later in the proof). The extra 96 bytes are a 32-byte public key and a 64-byte signature (over the whole transaction, including JoinSplits but excluding scriptSigs) to cryptographically-bind JoinSplits to the rest of the transaction.

I've been saying 'chain split' these days instead of 'blockchain fork' since 'fork' is an old term from open source which means to take someone else's code and begin modifying it, and both uses of the term fork apply to cryptocurrencies, so a lot of people get confused.

zclassic is a 'source code adaptation' and a separate network from zcash.
ETC is a chain split from ETH: they were once the same network.

Also, what's the deal with the monero paper? It seems to be hurting zec's image. Would like to hear directly rather than twitter opinion ☺
zooko Electric Coin Company 4:24 PM
The deal is
Andrew Miller et al. did this research and wrote this paper and published it.
And if Zcash gets any credit or association then IMO this will be good, not bad, for Zcash's image in the long run. But I have no control over those researchers.

I could be wrong, or mislead, and am willing to accept that fact but that's why I'm here asking and not on Twitter!
zooko Electric Coin Company 4:56 PM
No, if you read the paper you'll see that the previous understanding of the issue was wrong.
See the section called “Comparison with related work on Monero linkability.” in the paper. http://monerolink.com/monerolink.pdf
If you are thinking about this as a battle of prices, for investors, then posting this paper seems like an attack on the competing thing's price.
If you are thinking about this as a process of providing services to users, then publishing this paper is a way to communicate to users that they are at risk and to developers that their thing has a flaw and needs improvement.
I think of it as the latter.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:09 PM
@lustro another metric I'd be interested in seeing: Number of transactions that have zero inputs and zero outputs (ie. only shielded transactions, rather than including shielding and unshielding transactions).
_is interested in finding a metric for organic traffic, excluding mining pool activity, that doesn't require more laborious block chain analysis_
It should be in between those two figures:

```
shielded <= organic <= shielded + shielding + unshielding

```

Actually, those bounds can more easily be narrowed, because mining pool shielding transactions can be easily eliminated, by not counting any transaction taking coinbase as input.
remeyemi 10:12 PM
Has joined the channel.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:13 PM
Unshielding transactions from mining pools can in theory also be eliminated, but that is somewhat harder to disambiguate from other places paying many transparent outputs from shielded ZEC (granted, that's probably only a mining pool use-case at present, but we wouldn't want to exclude future usage too early)
And then of course there is correlation of shielding and unshielding mining pool transactions via ingoing and outgoing ZEC values, but IDK how much overhead that would be to try and track/find.
(And as mining pools start accepting z-addrs, that should be removed as a viable view, but that gets into third-party policy decisions that we can't easily influence)
Hmm, actually we *can* influence to some degree - I now vaguely recall a discussion on one of our issues about warning users of privacy loss if they shield ZEC and then immediately unshield it.

how many note commitments are there at the moment?

(oh and hello everyone)
hubot Robot 5:30 PM
Hey karelb, Hello!
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:30 PM
@karelb likely, for two-byte versions etc.
karelb 5:30 PM
yep
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:31 PM
Yeah, I didn't see your changes earlier, or I'd have probably worked off that
karelb 5:31 PM
Yeah I don't have it tested at all, though, great you did that
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:32 PM
I've tried to make my changes somewhat modular too, as I was pretty much duplicating code from my Bitcore patches (but cleaner and significantly extended in this case, to properly handle JoinSplit creation)
I'm starting to think that it would make more sense to shift the Zcash primitives into their own library, that can then be used by derivatives of bitcore-lib, bitcoinjs-lib etc.
But I'm not a JS dev, so that looks Hard (TM)
karelb 5:34 PM
also bitcoin tx version 2 was a pain... I was under the impression BTC transaction cannot have version two, so I made a code that parsed any tx with version 2 as a zcash transaction... and that broke all version 2 transactions on mytrezor for a while 😕

    😬 1 

all shapeshift transactions are version 2
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:35 PM
Huh, interesting
karelb 5:35 PM
it's used for some locktime stuff on bitcoin
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:37 PM
Ah, I see Bitcoin Core bumped the default transaction version to 2 in August 2016
karelb 5:37 PM
it's bad that a lot of bitcore stuff duplicates bitcoinjs-lib, but it's hard to refactor, especially now when bitpay stopped developing it
@str4d hm, interesting, that means not THAT many servers use bitcoind... there is still a lot of v1 transactions
s/bitcoind/bitcoin core/
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:38 PM
Or they just don't use bitcoind for making transactions, instead using libraries
Yeah
Anyway, I agree with the duplication issues, but given their different implementation strategies, and the general inability AFAICT to overload stuff in JS, there's still a need for impl-specific modifications
But I think that can (for now) be limited to block header and transaction format modifications
All the Zcash primitives are used below JSDescription inside CTransaction, so there's no need for any of that to be impl-specific
karelb 5:40 PM
yeah... segwit factors into that somehow (if you want the same code for bitcoin and zcash), but that's still under "transaction format"
(segwit signalization can have false positive on zcash txs)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:41 PM
Yeah, that complicates things significantly (which is why my PoC branches from bitcoinjs-lib 2.2.0 which doesn't include segwit)
karelb 5:41 PM
oh I didn't notice that
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:41 PM
(a little annoying, because that version doesn't work with latest NodeJS because of a test failure I had to fix, and also there are cleanups in 2.3.0 that I'd like to have)
If this goes more formal, I was planning to go through the few hundred commits since 2.2.0 and cherry-pick out everything that wasn't segwit-related
karelb 5:42 PM
oh
😕
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:42 PM
because I don't yet see how to make bitcoinjs-lib support both Bitcoin and Zcash easily
karelb 5:43 PM
look at my fork if you want... it supports both... but there might be some issues
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:43 PM
IIRC there's an open issue for making transaction format definitions more modular, which might help there (motivated by other altcoins that make changes to the transaction format)
(Or was that in pybitcoinlib? Hmm...)
You said your code was needed for mytrezor? So it's being used in production?
(Mine most definitely is not production-ready :P)
karelb 5:45 PM
Not yet
Oh wait, it's probably already on beta... https://beta-wallet.trezor.io/

not sure now... yeah it is on beta actually
I would like to add some zcash test later
I will maybe copy them from you
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:47 PM
Then you'll probably like where my code is going, because the end goal of this PoC is to make it possible to shift proving computation to a remote service 🙂
karelb 5:47 PM
yeah I know
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:50 PM
I'll have a look more closely at your code later this week, and see how it changes my mental model of a bitcoinjs-lib with Bitcoin and Zcash support 🙂
The main issue I have with such a setup is that going to that effort would only really make sense if it eventually would be landed upstream, but IDK whether they would be amenable to it.
OTOH there's a balance between reducing code duplication (between upstream bitcoinjs-lib and a Zcash-only fork) vs. not constraining Zcash to fitting the Bitcoin Core model

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:52 PM

whereas I am adding everything necessary to create a shielded transaction
karelb 5:54 PM
yeah
makes sense
different goals 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:54 PM
The key part I'm currently missing is signature-handling
(joinSplitSig)
Yeah, the more I talk about this, the more I'm convinced I need to shift everything from the `src/zcash` directory (plus `src/jsdescription.js`) into its own project, plus providing helpers for the modifications to transactions (such as for creating JoinSplits - it's important that it be handled carefully for privacy purposes)
So then other JS libs can just `require('zcash-primitives')` and add the necessary hooks.

Looks like my wallet thinks the change from the transaction went to the sender address but in fact it went to some other address...
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:16 AM
Huh, that's confusing. Can you open a ticket, please?
Was this a transaction created by z_sendmany?
eli 2:18 AM
Thanks for your response, Daira. Yes, it was.
As I understand by default the wallet should send the change to the sender account?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:19 AM
And what type of addresses were the source and destination?
eli 2:19 AM
t-addresses
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:19 AM
I think in that case it currently creates a new t-address for the change (like in Bitcoin)
(The behaviour of change for z-addresses and t-addresses is different, we're going to try to make it more consistent in a future version.)
eli 2:21 AM
so it seems , but i can't see the new address in my wallet and my wallet sees the change in the sender address.

otttis 9:36 AM
@dominik does payment offloading expose the private key to the third party?
@paige i meant
paige Admin Moderator 9:47 AM
@otttis the idea is for the proving service to be watch-only, requiring the light client to sign the transaction. Note: the first iteration will support t->z with z spending coming after that. When z spending is implemented, the proving service will have access to view encrypted data, but not spend. This proving service, however, can be operated on a personal server so you can offload to a trusted machine if that suits you better.
otttis 9:50 AM
wow @paige thanks for explaining, that's pretty amazing. so you're saying that if I didn't have my own server, I could use a public one, and the worst that can happen is that the public server knows the amount of the z output created?
paige Admin Moderator 9:53 AM
right, the public server would have access to the encrypted contents (value, addresses, memo) but would send that transaction back to the light client to actually sign + spend.

right, it's just that device won't be a raspberry pi any time soon 🙂
unless there is a xeon pi...
@paige can proving be split across lots of different processors, so theoretically you could have a public proving cluster that would prove your transaction in just a couple of seconds?
or maybe you tell your mobile wallet your amazon ec2 credentials and it temporarily fires up 20 servers for 5 seconds

hi, i'm investigating the challenge of implementing signing and verifying zcash transactions in a web browser. i am the author of Yours Bitcoin, which can sign and validate bitcoin transactions.
our script interpreter is copied and translated from C++ to javascript
i see the zcash interpreter is very similar, if not identical, to bitcoin
i also have found information on the structure of zcash transactions, and see that they contain extra data. so i take it the differences between bitcoin and zcash are mostly in these other structures and NOT in the script interpreter

    ☑ 1 

can someone point me to where the differences are in zcash with respect to signing and verifying a transaction/
also i see there is a bitcoinjs fork for zcash. does this library support signing and verifying zcash transactions? it seems to be a WIP and some things like the networks.js file are unchanged
also, a search for "CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY" in the zcash script interpreter does not reveal anything, although i see CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY is there.
does zcash not support CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY? are there plans to support it?
bitcartel 12:00 PM
Hi Ryan, Zcash is based on Bitcoin 0.12.1 so CSV is not present. I don't believe a definitive decision has been made yet about backporting it.
ryanxcharles 12:01 PM
ok, FWIW please count my vote as DO SUPPORT 🙂 we are investigating the feasibility of using zcash in Yours. we require CSV as it is a requirement for our payment channels technology.
bitcartel 12:01 PM
Good to know.
ryanxcharles 12:02 PM
it would probalby only require a few days of effort do support the zcash transaction structure & validation as best i can tell at first glance, though that depends on how hard the "special zcash" stuff is to re-implement. CSV is a requirement for us though - otherwise we would have to make substantial changes to our protocol which is far harder.
bitcartel 12:08 PM
Do you intend support either or both transparent tx (bitcoin style) and shielded tx (ZK privacy)?
ryanxcharles 12:08 PM
we would probably start by supporting only the bitcoin style at first, and add shielded tx later. privacy is not our core focus.
...assuming that's possible
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:01 PM
@ryanxcharles You probably want to read the Zcash protocol spec
https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf

    github.com
    zcash/zips
    zips - Zcash Improvement Proposals

particularly section 6 on consensus changes from Bitcoin
btw if you download the PDF and view it with a desktop viewer, the sections are nicely hyperlinked
ryanxcharles 1:10 PM
thx!
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:14 PM
you'll also need at least section 5.6 on address formats
(Zcash uses two-byte address prefixes, in contrast to Bitcoin's one-byte prefixes)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:05 PM
@ryanxcharles I have a WIP fork of bitcoinjs-lib that implements nearly everything you need (currently missing signing and verifying, but handles all the additional data), but it needs more dev work to be production-ready. What do you use as your JS base for Bitcoin?
ryanxcharles 3:05 PM
wow, awesome! we use Yours Bitcoin - my own implementation. https://github.com/yoursnetwork/yours-bitcoin

    github.com
    yoursnetwork/yours-bitcoin
    yours-bitcoin - Javascript implementation of Bitcoin.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:06 PM
Okay, so that reinforces my earlier thoughts that I should split out the Zcash primitives into a common library that can be used in several places.

    👍 1 

ryanxcharles 3:08 PM
yes, but depending on what that is, we might want to re-implement things anyway
Yours Bitcoin is a large library that we use intimately throughout our entire project
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:09 PM
In terms of what you need, it's been listed above - for v1 transactions (transparent-only like Bitcoin), all you really need to handle is 2-byte address prefixes. For v2 you need to parse and understand all the shielded data (but not necessarily create it, although the proof of concept I'm working on is specifically to enable t->z in JS)
ryanxcharles 3:10 PM
2 byte prefixes will be trivial. how is the extra data encoded in the zcash tx?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:10 PM
The Zcash primitives are pretty self-contained. The per-library changes are the extra data in v2 transactions, and the altered block header
(well, v2 and above)
ryanxcharles 3:10 PM
if my code parses normal bitcoin txs, can it also parse a zcash tx?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:11 PM
Section 6 of the protocol spec that @daira linked to specifies it all
It will parse v1 Zcash txs
ryanxcharles 3:11 PM
oh, so it's a different version transaction? so a v1 transaction is the same as bitcoin?
are you using the same version byte as bitcoin? in bitcoin, v2 transactions are for CSV
so there's a bit of a conflict there
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:12 PM
Yes (oh, except we removed CODE_SEPARATOR, IDR if that affects parsing)
Same version byte, yes. So we would be using a different version byte for CSV if/when we pull that in.
ryanxcharles 3:13 PM
ok i see
so in our case the biggest complication is that we are using CSV and v2 bitcoin transactions
our tech won't work with zcash without CSV - however if you guys add it, it sounds like it shouldn't be too hard to support it

    👍 1 

then again i guess you probably won't add CSV into your v1 bitcoin txs. that is, when you do add CSV, it will probably extend your v2 transactions into a v3, and as such we will have to be able to parse your v2 and v3 transactions. and then to validate we will probably need to do custom zcash stuff.
to simplify it in our case, a transaction version that was the same as bitcoin but without the zcash v2 stuff would make it easier for us.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:16 PM
If we just use Bitcoin's PR then yes. But we do have plans to hard fork changes in though, which might make that easier.
ryanxcharles 3:16 PM
ok
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:16 PM
Heh, that might be easier, but that's unlikely to happen ☺️

    ☑ 1 

But the additional data is at smallest a single zero byte

    ☑ 1 

ryanxcharles 3:17 PM
no worries - do what's right for zcash 🙂 our case is slightly unusual.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:17 PM
(if there are no shielded transactions)
IDK how you are using transactions, namely whether you need to parse any network transactions or only your own
ryanxcharles 3:18 PM
do the hard fork - i would love to see another cryptocurrency do a successful hard fork and continue to prove to bitcoin people that it can be done 🙂

    😁 2 

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:19 PM
If all goes well, we have two planned for this year - a simple initial one to make future HFs easier, and then a big shielded transaction crypto upgrade.
ryanxcharles 3:19 PM
no, we only need to validate our own transactions. we can trust a transaction if it comes from elsewhere. our users need to validate the txs they send to each other though. our tech is payment channels - users have to validate the "funding transaction" and "commitment transaction" without broadcasting them
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:20 PM
Okay, but do you need to *parse* arbitrary network transactions?
ryanxcharles 3:21 PM
maybe not ... if we can trust they are confirmed by querying the blockchain, and we can get the UTXO without having to parse it ourselves, e.g. by using a blockchain API, then we don't need to parse them ourselves
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:21 PM
If you don't then you can cheat when parsing. If you do then you'll need the mechanics I'm working on.
ryanxcharles 3:21 PM
ok sounds good 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:23 PM
Anyway, I'll look at your Bitcoin library to see how it would best include the Zcash primitives, so I can hope to de-duplicate work as much as possible 🙂
ryanxcharles 3:32 PM
ok cool 🙂

isn't it possible to make a joinsplit combining shielded and transparent funds?
so, from what i see in sendmany, you cannot select which addresses to combine, just the account (which if i am not mistaken is just the set of all yout taddreses)
thanks

@daira I'm wondering if we have control over what apt-get upgrade zcash does. Perhaps I don't know what I'm talking about, but it seems reasonable it can find a way to upgrade Zcash, when some generic other repo's update doesn't work.

tromer Zcash Foundation 12:32 PM
@radix42, @miguel.marco: while the Zcash protocol supports transactions sending funds from any combination of t-addresses and z-addresses, the current `z_sendmany` RPC can only send from a single t-address or a single z-address. (https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1785)

    github.com
    Add rpc call to shield multiple taddrs to a zaddr · Issue #1785 · zcash/zcash
    Add new call, a variant of z_sendmany, to allow user to sweep utxos from multple taddrs to a zaddr. Brainstorming: z_shieldmany zaddr memo --> take all available utxos, subject to tx size limits, a...

So sending funds from multiple addresses using the RPC currently requires multiple transactions (e.g., aggregate all funds into a single z-address, and then send from there).

hei guys, when I do `zcash-cli --help` it shows me the options but not the commands. where can I get a list of commands? I'm trying to figure out how to see my mining balance
oh... no dashes. odd syntax
yes, I get it now. --help is help about the zcash-cli command
no, it makes perfect. I'm just being dumb
how can I verify that the daemon is mining? I would have expected to see something from getmempoolinfo but it's all 0s
and is there a facility to tell what my current hash rate is?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:32 PM
The metrics screen (if not disabled) would show that, but you can also use getmininginfo
ekkis 6:33 PM
I looked at mining info and it shows me the difficulty but not my hash rate
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:33 PM
@ekkis what version are you using?
ekkis 6:33 PM
yeah... I'm going to read the section on pooling first
the latest
1.0.8-1
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:33 PM
Also, `getlocalsolps`
ekkis 6:34 PM
0
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:34 PM
Then you're not mining
ekkis 6:34 PM
aha
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:34 PM
And `getmininginfo` will show `"generate": false`
You'll want `gen=1` and `equihashsolver=tromp` in your zcash.conf
ekkis 6:35 PM
so I have `gen=1` and `genproclimit=-1` in the config file
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:35 PM
Huh
ekkis 6:35 PM
I also turned on tromp
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:35 PM
Are you sure your zcashd is using that config file?
You can also use `setgenerate` to configure it on-the-fly
ekkis 6:35 PM
getmininginfo shows generate: true
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:35 PM
(see `help setgenerate` for usage)
Ahh
Have you just started this node?

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:36 PM
You won't mine anything until your node has downloaded the block chain
ekkis 6:36 PM
ah
of course
silly me
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:36 PM
I should have thought of that earlier 😅
ekkis 6:36 PM
is there a way to know the hashrate I currently have?
or rather, hashing power?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:37 PM
The metrics screen in 1.0.8-1 should show that though
(ie it should show a message saying why mining is paused)
ekkis 6:37 PM
_looks for metrics in the help output_
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:37 PM
@ekkis you need to run zcashd in the CLI, not as a daemon
ekkis 6:38 PM
oh I see
and I can't do both, right?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:38 PM
Or set `-metricsui=0`
Then it will post metrics every 10 minutes (by default) to the log
You should see the details at the end of `zcashd --help`
Oh wait, the sequential output is still to stdout, not the log
ekkis 6:39 PM
yeah, I see that
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:39 PM
That was intended for e.g. system services, where stdout is redirected to a different log
ekkis 6:40 PM
precisely
you can always pipe it to a log file
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:40 PM
So if you're just running `zcashd -daemon` then you wouldn't see it.
ekkis 6:41 PM
getblockcount reports 98555. so I'll hang for a bit till it finishes
I'm wondering what my hashing power is because I have another box where I'll run the miner and I want to compare them
eventually I want to set up a rig
with 6 GPUs
but is that going to help?
I see the config has options to do CPU mining but does that mean that GPUs are not needed or useful for this?
oh...
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:46 PM
I'd like to get GPU mining code into zcashd at some point, but I have a long todo list
(And talk about that should go into #zcash-mining or #zcash-miner-dev)

@daira in that context, the update banner links to the download page https://z.cash/download.html, with instructions for installation from scratch . Perhaps there should be a line about how to just upgrade if you've already installed. I wonder if the command I use above is the optimal choice for upgrading @kevin ?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 10:40 AM
I'd be wary of advising people to use `--fix-missing` routinely
it can break your system hard
mainly because `apt-get` has a habit of uninstalling critical stuff if it conflicts with something you're trying to install

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:47 PM
Creating blocks requires holding global locks, so when that takes several seconds, other ops requiring those locks won't return

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:11 PM
The workaround is to call GBT less often (ie not every few seconds)
While network load is this high, calling GBT every few seconds, when GBT takes a few seconds to run, means that the global locks are always held, and nothing else can be worked on.
Xandrah 4:12 PM
And why is it this high, whats causing it. zcash locking up like this is practically making it useless.
you cant even do getinfo for goodness sake

@str4d Im going to test that pr right now
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:15 PM
There are two bottlenecks in GBT that are affected by the current network load:
- Loading transaction inputs from disk
- Signature verification times (due to each tx having many inputs, and the quadratic hashing problem)
The PR should help with the second bottleneck
lustro 4:19 PM
I'm quite skeptical that these are accidental mining pool payouts or something.
These are all *different* t-Addresses being unshielded to.
Someone would have had to be mining at a pool with 0.01 ZEC threshold and changing their address extremely frequently.
Which there is no incentive to do (AFAIK).
Nor are the payouts uniformly thresholded at 0.01 ZEC (although that is the most common threshold).
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:22 PM
All the addresses I looked at were first seen in November or December last year, and all were funded by mining-pool-like transactions.
I haven't had a chance to look at the contents of the latest waves though (syncing my local blockchain now)
lustro 4:24 PM
Newest address I've seen (so far) first seen 16 days ago - https://explorer.zcha.in/accounts/t1NVmkFSXwqRWUtYC6Stwxe7mi1xE8iW8wv

Check your debug.log with `-debug=zrpc` (or `-debug=zrpcunsafe` but don't paste that contents)
sammy007 7:29 PM
On the same deamon i shielded it from generated transaction
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:30 PM
I expect the problem is the change amount is hitting dust
sammy007 7:30 PM
damn this is production mining node, I need to test on another machine, will take time. Can `minrelaytxfee=9999999999` affect it?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:30 PM
Shouldn't (that isn't used anywhere in z_sendmany)
The thing you need to check is your input note value
If you're trying to send 9.9998 with the default 0.0001 fee, and the input note being selected is not exactly 9.9999 ZEC, then a change output would be generated that could be very small.
sammy007 7:32 PM
getbalance of this address is 9.99990000
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:33 PM
Then it *should* be fine...
But you'd need to see the debug output to know what exactly was triggering the error.
sammy007 7:33 PM
yeah I just used same script I use for several months, pretty weird. Will check on another machine very soon
bitcartel 7:37 PM
Yes, the dust threshold is derived from minrelaytxfee. By raising minrelaytxfee, the dust threshold is also raised, which means the 0.0001 fee output is considered dust.

sammy007 7:37 PM

sammy007 7:39 PM
So why it does not affect t-z but affects z-t?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:41 PM
Probably because t->z isn't creating outputs that would be below dust (since values can't be seen inside JSs)
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:18 AM
t->z still outputs a transparent 0.0001 ZEC fee
Let's calculate the dust threshold for minrelaytxfee=9999999999
_looks at the code_
(Note: I have to leave for a medical appointment soon.)
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:45 AM

```
    CAmount GetDustThreshold(const CFeeRate &minRelayTxFee) const
    {
        // "Dust" is defined in terms of CTransaction::minRelayTxFee,
        // which has units satoshis-per-kilobyte.
        // If you'd pay more than 1/3 in fees
        // to spend something, then we consider it dust.
        // A typical spendable txout is 34 bytes big, and will
        // need a CTxIn of at least 148 bytes to spend:
        // so dust is a spendable txout less than 54 satoshis
        // with default minRelayTxFee.
        if (scriptPubKey.IsUnspendable())
            return 0;

        size_t nSize = GetSerializeSize(SER_DISK,0)+148u;
        return 3*minRelayTxFee.GetFee(nSize);
    }

```

so, dustThreshold = (serializedSizeInBytes + 148)*minRelayTxFeeZECPerKB*3 / 1000
where serializedSizeInBytes is around 34. let's check whether that's consistent with the default minrelaytxfee of 0.000001 ZEC/KB
(34 + 148)*0.000001*3/1000 ZEC = 54.6 zatoshi (so yes, this is as expected)
(34 + 148)*9999999999*3/1000 ZEC = 5459999999 ZEC
so you probably want to use a lower minrelaytxfee
ok I have to go now

@slydrule: do you have measurements of your zcash node's memory usage?
zooko Electric Coin Company 1:42 PM
Folks: we've investigated and there's no evidence of malicious attack, nor of a security vulnerability.
We're going to be deploying improved measurements of the live network in order to get visibility into things like node RAM usage, transaction-time-to-confirmation, orphan rates, etc.

    :ZEC: 1 

We're also adding benchmarks of this to our Continuous Integration system so that we can optimize the zcash software to handle this kind of load better.
We currently have the following recommendations for users:
• Provision at least 8 GiB of RAM for you zcashd nodes.
• Assume that calls to `GetBlockTemplate` can take up to 15 seconds to complete when the blockchain is under load.
• Don't treat a transaction as final until it has 10 confirmations (which typically takes about half an hour).
• If you have any problems, either with these performance issues or anything else, or if your zcash software is doing anything "weird", contact us!

There are multiple options for people to get into buying, owning, and using Zcash, but I'm not sure which of the options is the easiest for a user who isn't a specialist in this kind of technology.

so I got my miner up and running. it indicates "Network solution rate | 57633915 Sol/s" - is that the average speed of the network right now? and if so, how can I find out my own speed? I'm curious about what the chances are that I could ever mine anything with this box
hellcatz 3:30 PM
If you want to play with your calculator....rough calculation: `((networkSolRate / mySolRate * avgBlocktime) / (24 * 60 * 60))` = days to find block....

Without looking manually through a few pages of https://explorer.zcha.in/transactions is there any way to get a general idea of the use of shielded transactions vs. transparent transactions? I'm not looking for anything particularly detailed.

@Ulysseus Turns out the MathJax CDN (for our blog post math rendering extension) shut down a few days ago, which was causing math rendering to break on those pages. We probably didn't see the issue because the js was cached for our browsers. I switched over to a new CDN, it should be fixed now. Thanks for pointing that out!

https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=NmKT23BTSosn5JgZ7 Note that statistic counts any transaction with one or more JoinSplits as a 'Shielded Transaction'. However some of those transactions have stronger privacy than others, since many of them are sending value to or from transparent addresses.
eiyuki May 3, 2017 7:57 PM
Ah, my mistake, it's listed fairly clearly under one of the statistics subtabs.

    ☑ 1 

One example is that mining pools often will sweep all of their coinbase (t-addr) rewards into a JoinSplit (because that's required by consensus) and then immediately send all of that value to many mining pool participants' payout t-addrs.
So it's somewhat easy to find the two associated transactions.
A strongly private transaction is one which has no transparent inputs or outputs, it only has Joinsplits.
Describing these nuances well is tricky, and we have several blog posts on this or related subjects.

@zooko , I'm just trying to understand correctly how does this system work. There are a lot of information about bitcoin, but only protocol about Zcash
So I want to understand how note keeps in blockchain( in particular, I want to understand how commitment tree and nullifier set keeps in blockchain)
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:45 AM
@vonnegut.orwell The final treestate of a block is the result of adding all of the commitments in the block's transactions (in the order they appear), and all of the nullifiers in those transactions (unordered) to the initial treestate of the block

eiyuki 4:56 AM
If I use ./src/zcash-cli z_sendmany "zaddr" "[{\"amount\": 0.5, \"address\": \"taddr\"}]" from the command line (with actual addresses) it works fine, but if I give the same command over rpc it doesn't. Does anyone have an example of how this should be escaped to send to the rpc?
eiyuki 5:14 AM
After looking a bit more at what the rpc is receiving, I am guessing the escaped quotes are being escaped resulting in invalid json, but I am not sure. '{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"zcash_gui","method":"z_sendmany","params":["zaddr [{amount:\\"0.75\\", address:\\"taddr\\"}]"]}'
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:15 AM
I'm not sure since I only use the zcash-cli myself, but since Zcash is built with many of Bitcoins RPC commands you may be able to find the proper syntax here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Raw_Transactions

    en.bitcoin.it
    Raw Transactions - Bitcoin Wiki

It may also be that z_sendmany is not supported over JSON since it is a unique Zcash command (not included in Bitcoin core) a Dev would be able to answer that better than myself
eiyuki 5:19 AM
I think it should be supported. Most of the other zaddr specific commands work fine over rpc.
I think it's because this one has a different parameter structure.
But thanks for the help. Hopefully someone will have an answer later.
I'm sure not many people are online now...
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:21 AM
Yes, and most of the dev team takes the weekends off, but they still pop in from time to time

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:18 AM
Don't double-escape the quotes in RPC

    ☑ 1 

They need to be escaped in CLI purely because they are supposed to be actual quotes in JSON-RPC
@eiyuki so this should work: `{"jsonrpc":"1.0","id":"zcash_gui","method":"z_sendmany","params":["zaddr", [{"amount":0.75, "address":"taddr"}]]}`
(also fixed the issue that the `params` field in JSON-RPC needs to be comma-separated IIRC, not quoted)

Is there a way to get the amounts sent from your zaddresses with the cli?

@str4d Thank you, that worked with a little bit of tweaking

json: { jsonrpc: "1.0", id:"zcash_gui", method: rpcCommand, params: params }

```

eiyuki 1:50 PM
@miguel.marco listreceivedbyaddress and z_listreceivedbyaddress might have some of the info you want. I'm not aware of anything that keeps track of "sent by address" but I could be wrong.
miguel.marco 1:51 PM
@eiyuki yes, that is what i am using. But as you said, it lacks the info about the sent transactions from your z_addreses
eiyuki May 6, 2017 1:50 PM
@miguel.marco listreceivedbyaddress and z_listreceivedbyaddress might have some of the info you want. I'm not aware of anything that keeps track of "sent by address" but I could be wrong.
in fact, listtransactions also shows you the sent transactions, but only shows the info involving transparent addresses
eiyuki 1:59 PM
I don't really see anything else in the list of commands. I guess if it isn't supported you could have an additional script that wraps around z_sendmany and store the result of z_getoperationresult <id> assuming there is someplace secure to store it. Although that still doesn't show as much as listtransactions.
miguel.marco 2:07 PM
i thiught about that: wouldn't work because I could have different backends making calls to the same zcashd wallet.

Hi all - I am considering to invest in ZCash (ZEC). After a bit of research, I saw that Z Classic (ZCL) (the fork of Z Cash) will soon launch Zen Coins that apparently is based on the latest technology. Why should I invest in ZCash (ZEC) or will ZCash owners soon buy the Z Classic, similar to what happened with Ethereum and Ethereum classic: only difference is the name - ethereum was the fork of ethereum classic and Z classic is the fork of Z Cash. Would be happy to hear your opinions ? Do you work together with z classic?

If the trusted setup was compromised and you figured out a way to do the setup without it being trusted after that, what can be revealed about the existing transfers?
Is it just the who sent who, (A transferred to B)
Is it the amounts.
Thanks!
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:12 AM
Nothing more would be revealed about existing transfers
Privacy doesn't depend on soundness of the zk-SNARK at all
Caveat: an attacker who actively exploits a balance violation might be in a better position to perform social engineering attacks that result in users' privacy being violated. But this caveat wouldn't apply if we moved to a proof system that prevented the hypothetical exploit before it was actually exploited

Is there an easy way to check if a public receive address is syntactically correct? Like a checksum internal to the address format? I've got a receive address generated by the trezor wallet app, but I'd like to validate it w/o sending it funds if possible.
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:24 AM
Easiest way to validate an address is to just send a very small amount, Trezor has been used by many here reliably so it shouldn't really be a concern
I don't know of a checksum for Zcash addresses, @str4d may know

@ry4an you can check that in Python:

base58.b58decode_check(address)

```

ry4an 9:42 AM
there a pypi package I need to pip into place for that?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:42 AM
No, base58 is built-in AFAIR
Try it and see 🙂

Naw, python2.7 doesn't include base58 by default anyway. I had to pip install it, but I've got it now thanks.

Ooof, I just sent ZEC to a bitcoin address when withdrawing from an exchange. The address started with 1* not z* or t*. Clearly my error, but I'm surprised that the exchange considered it a valid transaction. Is it most likely I just sent money to an unspendable address?

Yay, exchange recognized it as an invalid transaction.

The following information is already publicly available: https://z.cash/blog/continued-funding-and-transparency.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Continued Funding and Transparency

From that and the current price of ZEC you can calculate how much money the Zcash Company is receiving from the blockchain.
You can also see how much money the Zcash Company took from investors in the past.

anyone having trouble syncing zcash4mac wallet?
hydropanic 10:17 AM
I try to compare all "anonymous" coins and what i found for myself, and why i bought ZECs: Lets just imagine all governments, most legal platforms deny blockchains/cryptos, because of "something". Lets imagine it is all forbidden and highly controlled. Lets imagine blockchain didnt find any use in real life.
Then what? Where and when can i use cryptocurrency? Oh wait, as we all know it is all started, when you try to sell/buy drugs on TOR. So we go back to bitcoin or...
Imagine yourself selling cocaine or you are really the bad guy selling heroine. So you are looking for the best ways to get money on your wallet and you find out, that bitcoin is not anonymous and secure at all. I dig it deep, i saw bitcoin and litecoin going to upgrade itself by implementing smth, that will make it more anonymous, BUT, you'll read there, that at the same time it will be more "difficult"? transactions, more times spend on sending/receiving.
So this bad guys have some choice here: Monero/Dash/Cloak/Zcash.
Monero - not fully anonymous - that is what you read on wiki. It is enough for me. I already dont like it, sorry monero, go to wiki and clear this info every day. They also take x8 more space, if i am right. Unlimited issue is a minus fr me too. But a lot people say monero is most private and anonymous coin atm, dunno...
Dash - preissue problems. Thats all negativity, cant say more about it. But i still prefer ZEC, because it is NEW. It is like Xbox360 vs PS2020. Though dash is far away dominating Zcash now in CoinMarketCap.
Cloak - info? trading volume? where are you cloak, what are you, are you invisible? Ok then, forget this...Marketing and being well known, easy to find info is a big thing in crypto now.
Zcash - sounds good, like a sound of a coin falling on the floor. I like logo. Latest tech in cryptography. I like your team, almost all look like nerds, like 4-eyes pr0s in cryptography. I saw some movies about cryptography, it is a f*ing genious business. Great team, great idea.
Oh, you take 20% of mined ZECs to yourselves, what a pitty. You say, that this money goes on developing your child. Zcash was second coin i saw on the internet in 2017, searching for some info. Means you guys REALLY invest money on developing/marketing. Idc if 1 of you - bigheads buys lambo on mined coins. I just hope, you wont crash with go-go girl under cocaine and you'll will be in a good mood at monday to work on privacy, defence of Zcash.
21 000 000 to be issued (same as bitcoin). This looks like same BTC, but a lot more private. Even if i buy pomidoros and potatos on internet with crypto, i want to stay anonymous. It is really viable for me. But i really hope, you continue marketing and boosting your idea, using 20% of mined coins. I am nervous right now, sold last things i had like car, some gold etc. and invested in ZEC and ETH. You sent a link, where i should look how much coins already mined, but i didnt understand it, i cant count by blocks. If i understand right, it is not the same as circulating supply, can you just tell me 2 things: "dont worry boy, we will rock all this cryptothing! and how much exactly coins mined already"?))

@hydropanic First of all we don't promote the use of Zcash for illegal activities, continuing to do so will result in a Ban. Secondly the Zcash Founders reward is 2.1Million coins of 21Million total coins to be issued (10%) not 20%. And Lastly the link I posted earlier https://explorer.zcha.in has box that says _exactly_ how many Zcash have been issued "Total Monetary Base"

Hi, when starting out with zcash for the first time, is there a minimal mount of zec I have to purchase?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:41 PM
Depends on where you buy from what the minimum would be
Like Bitcoin you can get as little as .0000001 ZEC
dustfinger 1:43 PM
Okay, I assume that I can setup a wallet without any zec at all to begin with.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:43 PM
Yes, very easy to do
dustfinger 1:44 PM
Do you know if it is technically possible to use the blockchain for things other than transfering ZEC? Or, could one have a 0 zec transaction?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:46 PM
You can use the memo field to send messages, but even those have to have the minimum tx fee
dustfinger 1:46 PM

oh, nm. minimum tx = minimum transaction fee, nothing to do with founders reward. Okay, I will look that up, thanks a lot.

If you are comfortable using Linux then it's simple to set up
Can be done in less than an hour, but a server may not give you much mining power, GPUS are much more efficient

smreko 6:59 AM
Hej, I hope everyone is well. One question, why zcash has both t-address and z-address, why not only z-address?
smreko 7:05 AM
And what is the main reason that an anonymous blockchain is needed? Why is it not good if the companies can read each other's transactions?
paige Admin Moderator 7:06 AM
@smreko t-addrs are useful for integration with existing bitcoin services and for use on mobile devices. Currently, z-addrs require about 3GB of RAM to send to or from. A future goal is to make z-addrs much easier and less intensive to use so we can deprecate t-addrs.
smreko 7:09 AM
Ok, but zcash is in not actually used for paying things the way bitcoin is. How much of RAM does a bitcoin transaction require and when will zcash reach that level?
paige Admin Moderator 7:09 AM
@smreko hmmm... financial privacy is important for individuals and businesses for a variety of reasons. Businesses need to protect their clients and protect themselves from competition learning about expenses/income.

    👍 1 

Zcash is not used for paying for things the way bitcoin is because it's like... 6 months old. Needs more adoption and t-addrs can help with that.
A bitcoin transaction resource usage is negligable.
(same with t-addrs)
smreko 7:12 AM
ok thank you
but I mean, what does 3 GB of RAM needed for a transaction actually mean, does it affect the speed of the transaction or the speed?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:16 AM
3BG of RAM is required to process/create a z (private) transaction from your computer. It takes a few more bytes​ in a block for a Z-transaction vs a T- transaction
smreko 7:18 AM
and it is always 3GB, not dependent on how much zcash I send?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:20 AM
The RAM required should stay consistent, but can take longer depending on the number of intputs
smreko 8:00 AM
ok, so when will these 3gb drop to bitcoin levels?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:06 AM
Processing a private transaction in Zcash will always take more computing power than a Bitcoin (transparent) transaction. But the plan in the future is to enable servers to do most of the heavy computation so the user can have a small/lite client on their end for private transactions

mineZcash Admin Owner 3:35 PM
One of the problems with any mixing service is that the anonymity set is limited to the number of people participating in the mixer. In my opinion it is _much easier_ (and more secure) to just send from z-address -->z-address with Zcash and not have to worry about the people running a mixer, adversaries watching the input/output amounts of a mixer or the number of participants in mixer.

It depends on the amount of inputs and outputs you're using on the transaction
Xandrah 7:13 PM
Its a pain as I need to wait for this to go through, its locked me out of using my 10 ZEC
Oh well, thanks for the input guys, at least I know I didnt do something wrong
anarch3 7:14 PM
There's a command you can use to drop the unconfirmed transaction on your side so you can send another one with a bigger fee, forgot what it was
Oh yeah, zcashd -zapwallettxes
Works for me with Bitcoin
I'm sure the Bitcoin pools use nodes that accept transactions regardless if they're double spending or not
Because of transaction fees

hej, so this 3 gb ram that zcash transaction is consuming at the moment, what does it mean for the user? Because when I tried my transaction it worked just fine
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:39 AM
It only applies when you _create_ a Z-transaction, say I have 5 ZEC in a t address and want to send it to my z-address then it will use the 3GB of RAM to make that JoinSplit.
smreko 10:39 AM
ok, but what problem does that make for the user?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:39 AM
But as far as transparent transactions, they work the same as Bitcoin
Depends on what the user wants to to
It they just want to send/receive ZEC without using private addresses, then it means nothing
smreko 10:42 AM
ok, so if you send z-cash transaction it slows your computer down?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:43 AM
That's why Exchanges, online wallets, pools etc use t-addresses for now, until z-address transactions are less CPU intensive
smreko 10:44 AM
alright thanks for that .. so is there a timeframe when the issue will be fixed?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:44 AM
For transparent transaction Zcash is many times faster than Bitcoin for processing

@smreko It can't be totally "fixed" as computing a SNARK proof is intensive, but we have a new version that only uses 1.4GB RAM that should be included in one of the next releases - hopefully in the next month or two

smreko 11:36 AM

nathan Electric Coin Company 11:51 AM

    This is now a design ticket, and does not include implementation. This comment about address revocation suggests a "time to live" for transactions, after which the transaction creator can be sure t...

smreko 11:52 AM
aha
nathan Electric Coin Company 11:52 AM
Our thinking is that the user experience will be roughly something like this: 'If you submit a transaction, and it's not fully confirmed within X hours, then you know for a fact that it has permanently failed, so you can then choose to reissue a new transaction, give up, or do something else.'
I believe this is much better than 'if you submit a transaction, and it's not fully confirmed within X hours, then you can try to issue a double-spending transaction with a higher fee, or try to remove it from your own mempool and hope miners follow suit, or just wait.'
smreko 11:53 AM
and all these kind of transaction get registered so that devs can look into what caused them then?
nathan Electric Coin Company 11:54 AM
Well, it's actually difficult to figure out what happens to a transaction that doesn't get confirmed.
smreko 11:54 AM
yes, it's better just to resend it
nathan Electric Coin Company 11:55 AM
That's because confirming into a block is the _consensus_ mechanism, so until that happens there's no consensus which means different network nodes see different things.
One common thing that might happen is that miners consider a transaction to be less worthwhile than other transactions, so the other ones get into blocks first. The problem is there's no way for miners to clearly communicate that to the transaction creator.
Another problem that can occur is that the transaction hasn't actually reached any miners yet, even though your own node can see it.
There are probably more cases, and even those two common cases are hard to diagnose.
smreko 11:57 AM
why do the miners have to know about the worthiness of the transaction at all?
dc76 12:25 PM
@smreko "worthiness" == profitability to the miner, which is a function of the mining fee.
smreko 12:28 PM
so a miner can choose whether he wants to mine a transaction or not. why not making all the transactions unknown to the miner and include them in blocks randomly
dc76 12:31 PM
I'm assuming the intent is to create an economic incentive to mine and that a market is most likely to support the growth of the network i.e. attract new miners as demand exceeds supply.
smreko 12:38 PM
but that should not neglect the small transactions, why not making their sizes unknown to the miners?
dc76 12:39 PM
that's a good question for the Zcash team.
nathan Electric Coin Company 1:25 PM
smreko: Miners can choose which transactions they place in a block using any criteria they wish. It would be cool if there were some way to force them to include a random set, but I don't know if that's possible, and anyway it's not yet developed.
If, in the future, Zcash migrates entirely to z-address transactions, and even more, made it so that there's no way at all to distinguish between transactions, that would be a solid step in that direction.
[OFTC/kewde[m]] @rocket.cat Bot 1:27 PM
Evening all 🙂
nathan Electric Coin Company 1:27 PM
There's a subtle trick in that case, though: someone who creates a transaction could contact a miner and say 'hey, if you include that in your next block, I'll pay you.'
Anyway, even in Zcash today, if you do a z-addr → z-addr transfer, the amount _is_ unknown to a miner (though they still see the size in bytes of the transaction, and the fee, and some other metadata).
If you ask _why_ a miner might choose some transactions over others, and if we assume there's no special 'off chain deals' like I mentioned above, then miners probably pick the transactions that pay the best fees given the cost to the miner of including that transaction.
These are great questions, btw!

@nathan Well, the price of cryptocurrency = how much people are interested in using it (technology of that concrete chosen coin), so i dont think it would be wise to not speculate and think about the price. Ofcourse your main aim is making a good "product", but at least this 4 years you gonna earn smth from what you are doing and you say, that you never speculate about the price?)) Why simple-minded people like me always ask this questions about the price, because we are far away from everything that is going around. I read news and forums and lot of different information on the internet. But you guys are the closest persons to this fuss, you talk about it, you work on it, dont you ever speculate about the price in your circle? You should know, most info there in internet is pure s**t. If you dont want to type your ideas here, pm me 😌

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:36 PM
@hydropanic I appreciate your enthusiasm but don't forget that Zcash is a _company_ incoporated in the USA. Not only is it tacky (which is why I don't speculate either) for the people who have power in the company to speculate on price, it may in fact be _illegal_, and could lead to accusations of insider trading. The only true investing advice that Zooko has mentioned before is to do your homework and not invest more than you can afford to lose. https://forum.z.cash/t/is-this-a-pc-worth-mining-on/2502/2

    forum.z.cash
    Is this a PC worth mining on?
    Here's my generic answer to all questions like this (and there are a lot of them!): If you're thinking of this as a money-making enterprise, I can't advise you, other than to say: do your research and don't invest more money than you can afford to lose. But if you're thinking of doing this because you love the idea of a global, open, censorship-resistant financial network, and you love the Zcash community and you want to be a part of it and support it, then go ahead! And maybe (or maybe no...

hydropanic 6:41 PM
Well😐 Consider i already made first mistake))Went all in Zcash. Now i understand i could do a lot money from trading, not just holding. Ok then, can you give info about approximate coins mined by 1 month?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:50 PM
Don't consider it a mistake, just remember Zcash is a very new and promising currency with a great team behind it, the future is still bright in my opinion. But if you're looking for a "get rich quick" scheme you may want to reconsider. As far as coins mined you can calculate based on the Block time of 2.5min and a block reward of 12.5 ZEC then you get approximately 216,000 ZEC every 30 days
But that's only for the first 4 years​, after that it will be half that and halve every 4 years after.

o/ str4d - if you responded to this question I asked last month, I never saw it, but I remain interested. Are you aware of any effort to get 'tromp' or another miner optimized for zcash GPU mining? I'd like, in my case, for nVidia to take most of the workload off of Intel's shoulders.
[Irc2P/str4d] @rocket.cat Bot 9:02 AM
Pretty sure all the main miners in use are combined CPU+GPU

[Irc2P/str4d] @rocket.cat Bot 9:03 AM
I have grand plans to get a good open-source miner into zcashd, but I have time myself and don't know of anyone else working on that
[Irc2P/effulgence] @rocket.cat Bot 9:08 AM
k - thx str4d - when I run tromp it almost instantly 'maxes out' all 4 of my logical CPUs - and I see no use of my discrete (optimus laptop) nVidia card - and yes - I'm well aware that laptop mining is very risky considering that the excessive heat generated is the enemy of all components.
[Irc2P/str4d] @rocket.cat Bot 9:11 AM
Yeah, most current miners will be using a standalone miner with a mining pool instead of the built-in ones.
[Irc2P/str4d] @rocket.cat Bot 9:11 AM
My end goal though is to have the internal miner support both CPU and GPU together, if possible deterministically.

I feel like this is a stupid question, but I don't know the answer. I've been mining for a few years with different cryptos and just started mining Zcash today using an R9 270. I started about 6 hours ago and only have 15 shares on flypool. Is this normal?

hey i got soem stupid ass questions if anyones here
I followed the sprout/get started guide word per word with hopes of mining and am now (I think) mining. This is my first attempt at ever mining, and I don't have a wallet set up. Do I need one?
Whenever I run the command getinfo to check my balance, it's always 0.000000, but my transactions number is always increasing
nathan Electric Coin Company 2:28 PM
@daws you might find better support in the #zcash-mining channel.
I believe if you run a solo miner on your CPU the chance that you will ever find a block is very small, so you might need to wait a loooong time to receive anything. On the other hand, if you join a "mining pool" you should receive regular payouts, though I expect they will be quite small if you're using a CPU.
daws 2:31 PM
@nathan Ok, thanks for the reply. I'm new to the entire mining scene, so just wanted to make sure I wasn't mining for somebody else's wallet or something like that :^) I was looking at joining a mining pool next too, so thanks
nathan Electric Coin Company 2:37 PM
Different people mean different things by the word "wallet". If you're running `zcashd` it has code for managing secret keys and the associated addresses, and that will store your mining proceeds. It's only interface is through the commandline (or RPC interface). Some people call that a wallet, but other people mean something with a nicer user interface. 😉
daws 2:41 PM
oh, that's perfect for me! How nice to hear that. So if I followed the user guide I should totally be mining? I wonder how long it may take until my balance is 0.0000001 or more, as of now it's trailing 0's
but I'm just running on a crappy CPU so I'm not expecting miracles, just confirmation
@nathan do you know what testnet : false implies?
nathan Electric Coin Company 3:32 PM
If you are 'solo' mining (outside of a pool), then your balance will never be 0.0000001, because you will either not win a block, so it will be 0, or you will win a block and your balance will become 10. Each block you win gives 10 ZEC.
But, the chance that you win a block as a solo miner on a CPU is probably very small. I haven't calculated it yet.
Does the terminal show your solutions per second?
Looking at https://explorer.zcha.in/ I see the total solution rate is 96584983 Sol/s.

    explorer.zcha.in
    Zchain - Zcash Block Explorer & API
    Zchain: Zcash Block Explorer, Analytics Platform & API. Browse and search blocks, transactions, accounts, statistics and more.

So if your zcashd shows Sol/s a rough estimate is by dividing your number by the total network number, and that's your chance of winning the next block.
daws 3:38 PM
@nathan oh wow, I really have no idea what I'm doing lol. I didn't realize it wasn't as simple as "mine this long and get this amount"
and wow my odds are shit, hahah. Well I'm mostly here this week to learn anyway

Hi @andrew-1 join the #zcash-mining channel and read through the conversations there
vyacheslav 5:46 AM
Usually I calculate network hashrate using difficulty reward and block time, but I don't know the coefficient of transforming
empirically it is close to 8000
(difficulty * coefficient ) / average_block_time
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:47 AM
The most accurate information you will find about network info is at zcha.in , and you can use whattomine.com to calculate your mining
vyacheslav 5:48 AM
I need historical walue of network hashrate
*value
so unforturnately it is not an option, because both this resourses can give me only realtime data
hashrate that is translated in blockchain is not really the same that is usually used for calculating PNL of mining
vyacheslav 5:51 AM
File Uploaded: 2017-05-24 20_35_54.png
this data from blockchain
can you pls specify how to receive propper hashrate or give me pls a coefficient of transformation difficulty to hashrate
???
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:55 AM
I don't know of a proper formula to calculate difficulty to hashrate, @str4d developed the algorithm he would be better equipped to answer that question

This PR is so huge, I really don't know ^^
arielg 5:24 AM
Like I wrote on github, this PR is for sending shielded tx and uses only 1.4GB. It will be tested more before being added to an official release
but so far has worked fine, so it would be great if someone wants to test it and report if it worked well for them 🙂
I'm guessing the worst thing that can happen if you run out of memory is that the tx will not be sent, but perhaps @str4d or someone else knows more
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:27 AM
@phinx if you have just mined the coins then you have to send them to a z-address first. Then once you have done that they can be sent to either t or z addresses
karelb 6:45 AM
thanks a lot
ok I am gonna test that 😃
If it even builds. Should I rebase on master?

Hi, I deeply read a protocol Zcash and Zerocoin, but i still have a few questions. I don't get how works digital signature: why is necessary create h_sig with h_1 and h_2? Why we can't use only h_sig? For security?
Second question: where i can find realization of algorithm, which is described in protocol? It is may help me to understand how it works more precisely. I would like to see realization of creating transaction in C++. Where i can get such information?

@vonnegut.orwell h_1 and h_2 are MACs over hSig keyed by the a_sk of each input note
vonnegut.orwell May 27, 2017 11:25 AM
Hi, I deeply read a protocol Zcash and Zerocoin, but i still have a few questions. I don't get how works digital signature: why is necessary create h_sig with h_1 and h_2? Why we can't use only h_sig? For security?
So this is effectively proving that whoever chose the inputs to hSig also knew the a_sk inputs to the zk-SNARK circuit, i.e. they control the input coins
If this were not proven, an adversary could potentially take the proof from one transaction and use it in a different one. Because hSig hashes the JoinSplit signature public key which signs the whole original transaction, the proof is effectively tied to the transaction and can't be reused
So the answer to your specific question is that h_1 and h_2 need to depend on something that is only known to the zk-SNARK prover, i.e. a private input to the circuit. (I don't know whether you could get away with only one of them; I'd have to think about that.)
It's not a particularly elegant part of the protocol. There's probably a better way to do it
For your second question, you'll have to look at the source code. Most of the relevant code is in src/zcash; it's fairly readable and well-organised
(Credit to @ebfull, @bitcartel, and @str4d for making it so.)

For example, i found this code: https://github.com/Zerocash/libzerocash/blob/master/libzerocash/PourTransaction.cpp. Here i can see all points of creation transaction in right order. I can't find the same code in zcash library. I find only Note.cpp in that directory, but it is not the same as PourTransaction.cpp

yes, please verify it. the more people looks at the code the better.
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:54 AM
Welcome to the chat Miguel , It's not that I don't trust your work but we have had bad actors posting links to files with Trojans lately. So I have to have someone verify
But just at first glance it does look promising and a interesting way to implement payment offloading
miguel.marco 9:56 AM
No problem. I totally get that verifying the code is the right thing to do.
The python code shouldn't be too hard to verify, it is under a thousand lines (no comments though).
The android code... I admit is much worse (I have no experience in java, so the quality of the code is bad).
Besides, I find java to be a language hard to really follow.
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:01 AM
No problem, It's great to have community members build things like this, even if rough around the edges it can be a great foundation for further development

miguel.marco 10:04 AM
I haven't looked into the details, but i know the general idea
That is nice, but I see a problem there: you are giving up some privacy, since the party that generates the proof must know the transaction data.
And since privacy is the main zcash raison d'etre ... I would prefear to give up as less as possible of it.

@miguel.marco Cool. So the Android app operates like a remote control, passing instructions through tor to your actual node?
miguel.marco 3:15 PM
exactly
bitcartel 3:15 PM
How does the node authenticate incomining commands?
miguel.marco 3:16 PM
You have to setup your zcashd to require a username and password
bitcartel 3:16 PM
and the node is reached via a hidden onion service address?
miguel.marco 3:16 PM
by setting the rpcuser and rpcpassword options in your zcash.conf file
yes. The desktop gui (pyzcto) has a panel to bring up the onion service
and shows you a qr code with the onion address, username and password that you can scan with the phone to "sync" it
bitcartel 3:19 PM
Got it. Cool, I'll try to find some time to play around with it. Been meaning to try out the latest version of Android Studio with Kotlin support 😉

I guess someone said at some point that zec development is not a community driven movement, but a company, and the idea "zcash is centralized" spreaded from there
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:38 AM
Well, Bitcoin Core development is funded by essentially two companies
(Blockstream and Chaincode Labs)
In any case, the degree of decentralisation of the protocol, the network, and the development process are three separate things
We are certainly aiming to making development less centralised to the Zcash company
The Zcash protocol supports a high degree of decentralisation. The Zcash network is currently too small, and mining is dominated by a few pools (but mining is less centralised than Bitcoin mining)
vonnegut.orwell 2:54 AM

@brianr: The ZSL/Quorum integration will support shielded transactions involving tokens. It won't protect the privacy of native currency transactions.
tom-1 5:59 AM
Has joined the channel.
brianr 6:47 AM
@dodger have you any more information on 'shielded transactions involving tokens'? From my understanding tokens in Ethereum are defined using smart contracts. Rules around transfer of such tokens are controlled via the smart contract functions. From what I've read about ZSL it can shield the sender and recipient of the transaction. But when a smart contract is being used for the token, the recipient of the transaction will be the smart contract address. The actual recipient of the token and value of the transfer will be included within the transaction data passed to the smart contract function. The smart contract will execute logic to record that party A has transferred x tokens to party B. Any node executing the smart contract must see the transaction data in order to do this. Are you saying that ZSL can somehow hide the transaction data and still provide proof of smart contract execution?
dodger Electric Coin Company 6:59 AM
Yes.
Don't worry - it's all going to be open source, so you'll be able to look at the code for yourself when it's released.
chris6 7:12 AM
thanks for the response @daira your my favorite member of the team. after zooko of course.
brianr 7:28 AM
@dodger excellent! So in your blog a couple of months back you wrote this ... 'integrating ZSL with the Ethereum codebase would make it possible to use shielded transactions to protect users’ privacy, but smart contracts would still need to be executed transparently. We are still in the early stages of researching how programmability can be implemented within ZSL in an efficient manner.' Can I assume you guys have solved this now?
dodger Electric Coin Company 7:29 AM
No, in Quorum, smart contract privacy is provided by Constellation.
You can think of ZSL-on-Quorum as implementing ZSL within a smart contract on the shared Quorum ledger/chain.
brianr 7:31 AM
@dodger ok thanks. I guess I need to do some further reading on this. is there any documentation on how this works?

Not yet!
You're ahead of the curve on this one. 🙂

Hi all. A bit of a tech question. We're implementing a Zcash deterministic module for Internet of Coins. Currently we're using a forked version of bitcoinjs-lib for this (https://github.com/runn1ng/bitcoinjs-lib), however it doesn't seem to produce a t-address. Is the 't' simply prepended to the public key in case of a Zcash t-address?

    runn1ng/bitcoinjs-lib
    bitcoinjs-lib - Bitcoin-related functions implemented in pure JavaScript

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:39 AM
No, the 't' is not just prepended. The raw encoding has a different (2-byte) prefix, and then that is Base58Check-encoded
See the Zcash protocol spec, section 5.6.1
@vonnegut.orwell Yes. But as far as I know we do generate random a_sk even for dummy [input] notes
vonnegut.orwell May 30, 2017 4:10 AM
@arielg @daira Okay, this code represent creation transaction with dummy notes?(I just noticed that value in Note.cpp is equal to zero and we work with dummy path in JoinSplit Statement)
*checks the code*
Oh, you mean for dummy output notes
Yes those have random a_pk (the difference shouldn't matter because they're going to be encrypted to a random pk_enc)
In any case the sender wouldn't (in general) know the a_sk of output notes, so there can't be any weakness in doing it that way over the case for real notes

@yafes the official zcash client would do the job, being a "miner" shouldn't be much trouble for you.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:02 AM
@agent725 @str4d and @bitcartel are likely more up-to-date with that than me
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:06 AM
@agent725 I've actually been working on just that today
Specifically, I've been extracting my JS code implementing the Zcash primitives into its own library
So then instead of having a bunch of repeated, unmaintained codebases, we can have a single one keeping parity with Zcash, and then use it in the actual libraries (the forks of bitcore-lib, bitcoinjs-lib etc)
I'm the origin of the currently-unmaintained Zcash JS libraries 😂 (bitcore-lib-zcash and a fork of bitcoinjs-lib) so hopefully this will make things easier
agent725 2:11 AM
Yay! 😀 We currently inject libraries in the browser only when needed for a transaction so we can support many cryptocurrencies side-by-side. So currently for Bitcoin we're using the original bitcoinjs-lib, and for Zcash I'm using the fork. But we've got a lot of crypto's to cover, and so I couldn't so quickly find out the perks of the bitcoinjs-lib-zcash.
@str4d, No problem for me to use the bitcore fork, if it is feature complete.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:14 AM
bitcore-lib-zcash was done to enable the Insight block explorer to work with Zcash. I expect you'd want a bitcoinjs-lib fork instead

Zcash t-addrs are `base58encode_check[prefix (2 bytes) | address (20 bytes)]`
cyst, probably not at the moment given that only the GPU miners have seen ongoing optimisation AFAIK, but it's not hugely slower, and there's at least one miner that contains both CPU and GPU
agent725 2:20 AM
@str4d, No problem for me to use the bitcore fork, if it is feature complete.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:21 AM
Depends on what features you need
It's feature-complete for parsing transactions, which is what was needed for a block explorer
I don't remember whether I implemented everything necessary to send v1 transactions
It definitely doesn't contain anything for v2 transactions though (containing JoinSplits), so it won't support z-addrs.
(The library I'm working on now will enable that kind of usage)
agent725 2:25 AM
Ok. Currently only looking at supporting v1 transactions. So people can at least store Zcash in a deterministic wallet.
I'm checking it out, and seeing that Bitcore is quite a large and extensive package. Light weight like bitcoinjs-lib is probably the way to go for now.

@chris6 it is realy hard.. i can understand this. You make a coin!, but you dont have a wallet to put it in LOL LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL.. i have an iphone and i phone only uses jaxx application.and jaxx doesnt accept coins from miners. so what is the solution. other wallets for computer , i even didnt understand what they are talking about.i installed many softwares but this is just a trouble. ARE YOU A PONZİ ZEC ?????

there you go , @yafes. prefect answer above. i suggest you do some research regarding exactly what zcash is.
still early days, a working safe protocol is the most important thing that i gather from the highly educated team.
also Jaxx is not recommended for many small payments from miners. keep your zec on your pool cash out less frequent. you won't have a problem. again research. then research some more.

Good grief! My Windows ZCashd is still running 2nd May (eight core Intel, latest generation) churning away those big blocks. 😃 This isn't criticism to the Windows one, by the way, I'm very glad it exists. If anything, I criticize myself not being able to muster time to work on CMake and make it easier to work on the code on Windows side... 😞

Part of the problem is the client crashes time-to-time and I haven't bothered to script a restart and I just restart from the command line whenver that happens. Maybe I should. Maybe I should transition into more serious mode with that. 🙂

agent725, I haven't looked at IOC, but I love that space. Very exciting. XCAT is our in-house 'project name' for what other cryptocurrency folks often call atomic swaps.
Tangent: I hear from @dodger that 'swap' means something different in finance, which is why XCAT stands for 'Cross(X) Chain Atomic Trades'.
(In English 'X' is sometimes used as an abbreviation for 'cross' because it has a crossing shape.)
dodger Electric Coin Company 4:11 PM
Yes, swaps are a family of financial derivatives, so using a different term avoids confusion.
(Swaps are also very heavily regulated.)

sorry if i ask how can i check if there is a block? sorry as i say i'm noob about crypto
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:11 AM
@jackreacher This means that the node has seen a "loose" transaction (i.e. not in a block) with a JoinSplit proof that does not meet consensus requirements, usually because its anchor is to an orphaned block
jackreacher May 31, 2017 11:33 PM
what does ERROR: AcceptToMemoryPool: joinsplit requirements not met mean
An "anchor" of a JoinSplit (implementing a shielded transfer) is a hash of a previous block, before which the shielded inputs are known to already have been created
Currently, when generating a shielded transaction a node will choose the hash of the most recent block it knows about for the anchor. This might end up being an orphaned block (i.e. on a short side-branch of the block chain), in which case the log message you saw will be logged at other nodes in normal operation
harisankar_sony 12:18 AM
Has joined the channel.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:19 AM
This is not a problem for the node that logs the message, but it does mean that the transaction is invalid (probably, unless the logging node is on a minority fork), and won't get into the block chain. We're considering a change to choose less recent anchors to avoid this problem: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/1614

    Cryptocurrency company pushes back against Shadow Brokers' latest claims - Cyberscoop
    The Shadow Brokers say they will be accepting Zcash for subscriptions to their monthly dumps of leaked NSA files — a decision intended to needle the U.S. government over its role in the cryptocurrency’s creation. But the company that oversees Zcash says that federal agencies have no ties to the cryptocurrency beyond some general connections to its academic roots. In announcing the subscription service, the Shadow Brokers insinuated that Zcash has links to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, other U.S. military agencies and Israel. “Maybe USG is needing to be sending money outside from banking systems? If USG is hacking and watching banking systems (SWIFT) then adversaries is also hacking and watching banking systems. Maybe is for sending money to deep cover foreign assets? Maybe is being trojan horse with cryptographic flaw or weakness only NSA can exploit? Maybe is not being for money?” the blog post written in broken English reads. Though the hacking group has claimed Zcash’s privacy …

If you receive a PM from a user asking for help in making this kind of transaction please notify me.

micah.zoltu 4:34 PM
Are you saying that if a user is having trouble using the ZCash tool suite you won't help them if they indicate that what they are using it for is to purchase something illegal?
Or are you saying that you won't help troubleshoot some third party platform tool suite?
The first seems _very_ against the censorship-resistant and fungible nature of the ZCash community. It seems like the ZCash team should be willing to help anyone use the tools, without prejudice.

The second seems reasonable, this isn't the place to go for help using some external tool suite not developed by the ZCash Company.
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:44 PM
This chat is not run by Zcash Company and your first assertion is correct. If a user indicates that they​ only want assistance for the purpose of purchase illegal goods or services (or in this case PMing me to do so) then they will need to find a different platform to chat on. There are plenty of other places on the internet to discuss such things that do not put My or Zcashs name on the line.

    👍 2 

micah.zoltu 4:44 PM
😢
So this leads first to users learning to just not mention _why_ they need help and instead making up some lie/story.
That, then, leads to support personal _asking_ "what were you trying to buy/sell?", then seeking proof.
And we are back at the current KYC banking problem.
Requiring users to lie to get support doesn't really solve any fundamental problems, it just results in less transparency.
So either you go full KYC/AML (which I think we can all agree is terrible) or your statement holds no real meaning/value (since you can't prove what users were buying/selling).
So it is unclear to me what you are trying to achieve.
Is this just a PR stunt to try to make people believe that ZCash isn't used for illegal goods despite the fact that we all know that some portion of its usage will be for exactly that?
I can appreciate the reasoning for a PR stunt like that, though it annoys me to my core (personal problem, I hate false pretenses). This all stems from my libertarian philosophy that it isn't the bank's job to tell you how you can and can't spend/earn your money. It is the bank's job to facilitate earning/saving/spending your money. I see ZCash as the bank in this scenario. I don't see ZCash as my nanny.
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:55 PM
I do support free speech and I am willing to help users as much as I can, and I do so every day here and on Reddit. But this is not the place to try and buy/sell illegal stuff. I'm not a Zcash Employee and this is not some PR stunt. I don't expect users to ask why someone needs help with anything Zcash, but the moment you say you want to purchase illegal things I am now liable if I continue to help you.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:56 PM
I see that as just a channel operator moderating their channel
There's no requirement for the channel operator or participants to provide support for those users, but there's also nothing stopping those users from finding support elsewhere.
micah.zoltu 4:57 PM
It seems there are easier ways to absolve yourself other than banning. For example,

    > Unfortunately I am personally unwilling to facilitate paying for a good/service that is illegal in my jurisdiction, perhaps someone else will be willing to assist you. Alternatively, if you need assistance with transacting in ZEC for other reasons let me know and I would be happy to assist.

My contention isn't with @mineZcash personally not helping someone, my contention is with:

    > any user solciting help with completing a Shadow Brokers transaction will be immediately Banned

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:58 PM
@micah.zoltu that implies that discussion of illegal activity is acceptable under the channel topic / rules
micah.zoltu 4:59 PM
Illegal activity in what jurisdiction?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:59 PM

Generally, the chanop's jurisdiction is relevant
But more broadly, it's the chanop's channel, and everyone else is there at the behest of the chanop. Same as any old IRC channel
There's nothing stopping people from setting up their own channels for discussions; they have complete liberty to do so
micah.zoltu 5:01 PM
Own channels on this rocket.chat?
Or go find another forum entirely?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:01 PM
Well, @mineZcash would be the servop in IRC lingo
And as with any IRC channel or forum, chanop rules are always a superset of servop rules
micah.zoltu 5:02 PM
I do agree with the statement that the channel/server operator has final say in what is allowed in their little piece of the internet. That being said, I feel like it says something about the the official ZCash chat server if it is abiding by particularly draconian rules.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:02 PM
(I was using chanop above interchangeably with servop, because on rocket.chat there's not much difference, whereas on IRC there is significant difference)
@micah.zoltu there's nothing particularly official about it

micah.zoltu 5:09 PM
The reason the two are different to me is because I am _looking_ to the ZCash Foundation as a source for censorship resistance in my life (I believe it is why we all want an anonymous coin). When I see the ZCash Foundation participating in censorship, it lowers my trust that their goals align with mine.
I interpreted "Community Dev Chat" as "The place where the community can chat with the devs".
amiller Zcash Foundation 5:09 PM
it's "a" place, for sure

amiller Zcash Foundation 5:10 PM
hey censorship is bad though so it would definitely be unacceptable if the moderation policy here was more restrictive than it is
micah.zoltu 5:10 PM
At this point, I now understand the situation and I'm _less_ bothered. Unfortunately, I don't know of a better way to communicate the situation to users than already exists, so I'll stop pushing on it (I don't have any solutions).
amiller Zcash Foundation 5:11 PM
so maybe micah.zoltu really wants to talk more about why the policy in this case is chosen this way and aobut where the boundary should be, i find that interesting so

Why would we need to know what someone is buying or selling, and especially why would we need proof? That doesn't seem necessary for user support in most cases.

    ☑ 2 

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:15 PM
Right. There is no obligation on support personnel (yet) to know that
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:15 PM
If there's a problem with a vendor, payment processor, etc, that's not our software so I'd refer folks to ask that site operator.
micah.zoltu 5:15 PM
I was arguing that the "don't ask don't tell" policy doesn't do anything other than reduce transparency and increase difficulty in troubleshooting.

    ❎ 1 

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:16 PM
Not entirely true
As in, it is itself true, but incomplete
micah.zoltu 5:16 PM
For example, if people are free to say what they were doing and there is a known issue with some particular integration/vendor, then the support cycle is much simpler, "Oh, we have heard that ShadowWhatever is having trouble with their payment gateway, check their support channel <here> for help."
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:17 PM
@micah.zoltu Note that this channel is bridged to an IRC network which has different operators and distinct policies.
micah.zoltu 5:17 PM
If people can't openly say what they were trying to do, the support cycle involves a bunch of beating around the bush.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:18 PM
Because that argument ignores the effect on the channel atmosphere (for want of a better word) of illegal (in X jurisdiction(s)) activities being discussed.
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:18 PM
To me it seems like the best development is having more venues for discussion spread to more places.

    👍 1 

micah.zoltu 5:18 PM
So I would be fine with a policy of, "If you need support with X, this is not the place and you will be redirected." That is very different from, "If you mention X word you will be banned."
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:19 PM
I'm quite grateful to @mineZcash for setting this server up, and I find the policy quite sensible and it fits well with ZcashCo's agenda.
micah.zoltu 5:19 PM
The first is helpful, while still keeping the atmosphere the desired temperature. The latter is unhelpful to anyone IMO.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:19 PM
That seems fair, if paired with "ignorance of that redirection/warning will lead to a ban"
micah.zoltu 5:19 PM
Sure, if you get redirected and _keep_ asking then ban seems reasonable.
(again to be clear, now that I understand this is a personal/community server I care significantly less about the current rules)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:20 PM
Part of this discussion revolves around the discoverability of the channel / server rules
Much of this is in the ToS, but I don't recall how visible Rocket.Chat makes those to the user on registration
micah.zoltu 5:20 PM
Historically, when I have run a chat server I assume no one has read the rules. If they do something against the rules, I politely inform them (and perhaps censor whatever they said/posted). If they continue, then I take more aggressive action.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:21 PM
(c/f an IRC server's MOTD)
micah.zoltu 5:21 PM
A big part of my reasoning for that philosophy is because I live in the US where you are expected to know all the rules but that is impossible as it is a full time job/lifelong effort to learn them all. I find this policy stupid because it is unachievable.
As someone eluded to earlier, "What drugs are 'illegal'? Can I buy Tylenol with ZEC and get support? Can I buy marajuana (which is now legal in a lot of the world)?" There are just too many rules to enumerate in a reasonably short way that people will actually read them.

I understand that distinction @micah.zoltu and agree that is the best course of action, perhaps I worded my first post too harshly
micah.zoltu June 2, 2017 5:20 PM
Historically, when I have run a chat server I assume no one has read the rules. If they do something against the rules, I politely inform them (and perhaps censor whatever they said/posted). If they continue, then I take more aggressive action.

I think this is all touching on a more general existential problem for Zcash: right now development and community is largely tied to ZcashCo which is bound by its own constraints and has its own agenda. What @minezcash is doing by operating this chat server (and many other things) is helping to at least move some of that infrastructure off of ZcashCo.
Ultimately though, if Zcash is to succeed long term, the community needs to become more decentralized.
So @micah.zoltu if you want to help set up another venue with a different focus or policies, I personally think that would be awesome!
😉
However, I'm reminded of the /r/bitcoin vs /r/btc vs /r/bitcoin_uncensored vs /r/… debacle.
The issue as I see it, is that /r/bitcoin became a locus and then over time the policies or moderator lineup changed.
micah.zoltu 5:27 PM
I wish I had the time to run another competing channel. I shouldn't have even spent the time required to have this debate... I'm just so "triggered" by censorship that I couldn't help myself. 😛
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:27 PM
Wouldn't necessarily be competing. Maybe we could have a bridge (at least until some policies or content differed).
-or they could specialize to different things.
micah.zoltu 5:28 PM
Sure, competing was probably the wrong choice of words.
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:28 PM
I try to align the rules of this chat as close to what I believe Zcash Co would also enforce as layed out in thier own Terms of Service on the forums https://forum.z.cash/tos

    Terms of Service
    Zcash Forum is the official Zcash community message board.

nathan Electric Coin Company 5:28 PM
Hm, I admit there's a tension between decentralization vs having a consistent locus, monolithic community, large network effect.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:28 PM
Chanop policies can be more restrictive than servop, so it would usually be possible to have at least one channel on both that could be relayed
(that assumes one servop's policies are a subset of the other's)
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:29 PM
indeed the terms of service posted here are almost identical to the original ones layed out by Zcash co: https://forum.z.cash/faq

    Zcash Forum is the official Zcash community message board.

micah.zoltu 5:30 PM
I'm personally a fan of Reddit's stance. Server-wide, there are almost no rules. By channel, the rules are defined by the moderator (and some are _incredibly_ restrictive).
And I believe the only server-wide rules Reddit has are those forced on them by the government within which Reddit owners/servers reside. (and those that protect Reddit as a service, e.g., no DoSing)
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:32 PM
I _personally_ like that, too. But since I'm bound by partially representing ZcashCo, I believe the company currently chooses to be more cautious, and I can't speak for @mineZcash 's motivations, but I totally understand not wanting the liability.
I think Reddit is a. large and b. part of their brand is their speech stance, so they can afford more lawyering and strategic choices to be less conservative.
Whereas if ZcashCo wanted to make our forums less restrictive, we'd have to spend more on lawyers, and we're actually a pretty tiny company. Same for @mineZcash where the relative expense would be even more massive.
Anyway, I haven't actually looked into having more permissive policy on the forum, simply because of focusing on other stuff.
So I think what I'm saying is that I personally sympathize with @micah.zoltu in principle, but in practice it doesn't seem like a big enough priority for me, and I'd guess the same is true of ZcashCo.

In fact, I just discovered https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/ and I'm really curious to try it out. Don't know if it would fit our use case, sounds more like a social-blogging use.

    www.scuttlebutt.nz
    Introduction · ssb-handbook

Has anyone played with scuttlebutt?
It sounds like you can create an identity tied to a key pair, then you can post updates to an append-only log, then you can subscribe to other people's pubkeys and if you do so you fetch their posts. Fairly straightforward sounding. There are LAN-only features and it's designed for intermittent internet access.
Not sure about transitive data relay (like A and B are both friends with C, so when A connects to B, they end up with the most recent C posts that either of them had).
Oh yeah, that reminds me of the IM-oriented p2p app that @str4d was working on.

i've been deeply moved after watching r/btc and r/bitcoin put such a schism in that community, it's rattled a lot of simple beliefs i used to have about community norms and such

    ✅ 1 

basically i used to think that since it's trivial to to *technically* create another channel, then there's no such thing as censorship
but that's totally unreasonable because the value is really the community / audience / network effect there, since an empty forum isn't rewarding to post in

    👍 2 

so, one idea, going along with the suggestions above, is to actively encourage multiple, decently-sized, communities, so that if one of them eventually becomes bad, the marginal cost of switching over to the other isn't so high
kind of like monopoly busting to encourage market competition
micah.zoltu 5:58 PM
So clearly what we need is a decentralized chat service and decentralized forum service so that someone can "managed/moderate" a community anonymously.
The issue here is that no one wants to be on the hook (legally) for running the "this is where you go to get support for purchasing child porn" (intentionally extreme example) chat room/forum. If one could run such a thing anonymously and the discovery mechanism was anonymous/automated (e.g., smart contracts) then the communities wouldn't be restricted by local laws of the moderator/server provider.
Individual communities could be moderated by whomever wanted to moderate them, and people would gravitate towards communities that allowed discussions that they were interested in. No one need be accountable for the actions of others.
valkenburgh Zcash Foundation 6:19 PM
I'm a bit late to this channel, but I'd like to put in my two cents. Like @micah.zoltu I too am a zealous advocate for free speech. However, according to years of accreted case law (and some of the most lucid and reasonable legal reasoning you can find with the constitutional law tradition) our freedom of speech is only gaurenteed in public spaces when a state actor attempts to censor it. You have no right to unfettered speech in another person's private space. To ask for such a right is to restrict another person's liberty. This forum is a private space as are most "places" on the Internet. We are all very lucky to be living at a time when true public (e.g. decentralized) spaces are emerging online, and to be doing our part to support the brilliant people who are building the tech that can make that decentralization possible. @amiller is right that the presence of multiple alternative private fora is not enough (I too used to believe that). Network effects inevitably lead to a single forum achieving dominance and the administrators of that forum may then pursue (for good and bad reasons) a approach to moderation that discourages diversity and free expression. I think @nathan makes a great point that perhaps we should seek a decentralized forum technology to ensure that there is a true public space for open discussion. But maybe helping Zcash thrive as a public place for more limited financial expression is ambitious enough 😉. Also, you all are pretty inspiring. I love the maturity and care taken in this discussion. Other communities show far less grace.

Tempest in a teapot. I would not worry about it too much. It's one thing for people to argue "all speech should be free" in principle, it's another thing for them to argue that you should bare the consequences of legal liability, especially when the people making the point are not liable. It's a perfectly legitimate concern to have.

It takes seconds to see a transaction appear in your wallet, but before the funds can be respent I believe it takes 100 (?) network confirmations

@kaspars It depends on the network, but from my experience it takes about 2+ hours to get the 100 confirmations. You can watch the # of confirmations in your wallet.
Which is alot faster than Bitcoin which takes about and hour for 6 confirmation​s

well I have been waiting almost 3 weeks messaged them almost every day and nothing
it's like a computer is responding is there even people over there, one person told me in the forum they waited 3 weeks, do I did not feel singled out when I learned that seems that their processing time and in the meantime a dropped occurred and I could have purchased at a very low cost
and coinbase does not offer ZEC, I swear its like pulling teeth Kraken is horrible
You just wanna buy and you sit and watch the market climbing while these people take forever wow, I hope they invent Crypto brokers soon
crypto.world 8:36 AM
Sorry you've had that experience, I'm surprised you can call them?? My own experience with Kraken has been nothing but good service, could very well be the rate of growth of trades & enquiries they are under resourced. @thefmgirl

thefmgirl 8:37 AM
heard coinbase crashed under pressure of too many people also, they have to be ready for the boom and be ready to accommodate the volume
I am so disappointed now ZEC rose by 100 since then, It's going cost me 1ooUSD more for their delay, I am peeved!!
I wish I could figure out how to do it in Changely, seem they all want you to already have Bitcoins which I am not interested in at all, ZEC and ETH is my preferred currency, they will go a long way
crypto.world 8:41 AM
Yes having BTC is much easier transferring from your Wallet to Exchange account. Fees are less too than transferring with Fiat- Euro/USD $
thefmgirl 9:00 AM
They have made this simple process which they market it 'AS' way too complicated, people waiting 3 and 4 weeks for blockchain confirmations wow, I am so disappointed!!, maybe since they love you so much Crypto-world you should call them or otherwise and put in a good word for me lol
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:51 AM
@thefmgirl Another option is to buy Bitcoin directly at an ATM or find someone close you on localbitcoins.com then you can use shapeshift or changelly to buy ZEC with the BTC
thefmgirl 9:52 AM
serious ok. let me ask someone to buy the bitcoins, cause I am realizing that I cannot buy ZEC directly this is a big joke lol wow wow tripple wow!!
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:52 AM
It's easier to find places/sites to buy BTC than ZEC now, unfortunately. I'm confident that will change in the future as Zcash grows
There are lots of regulations that business that do USD to BTC transactions have to comply with (in the USA)
Which also may be why Kraken is so slow, everyone wants to get in/approved to buy. Probably a big backlog.
thefmgirl 9:58 AM
wow remember they came up with this method to avoid the "process" now we hit by the said same thing we running from, the Irony lol

@miguel.marco could pyzcto also be used with ZCL and ZEN?
miguel.marco 7:27 AM
It is just a front-end that communicates with the node through the RPC interface. So as long as they have a compatible interface, it should work.
akiron 7:27 AM
Great. Also, is TOR an absolute requirement for use?
That is, if I don't need the TOR features, do I still need a TOR client installed?
miguel.marco 7:29 AM
You only need tor if you want to sync the android wallet.
Otherwise, just ignore the tor tab and everything else should work ok

karelb 8:23 AM
hey, a stupid question. If I want to send to/from shielded addresses, I have to use z_sendmany, right
none of the other CLI RPCs work
so I need to calculate fee etc myself, right
and I need to add change to z_sendmany by hand?
or not
oh no, fee is there, and change is there too automatically
cool
can I put some "notes" to z addresses to know which is which? (similar to "accounts" in bitcoind/t-addresses)
the PR branch with the low memory is cool btw, finally I can actually use this stuff 😃

    😀 2 

karelb 10:02 AM
I am also thinking - how could Trezor (or similar wallets) be integrated with z-cash? I see you have a PR for extra proving service, that could be run on PC, but how is it with detecting, which transactions in blockchain belong to the user
Do you need private keys for that or no?
(talking about shielded addresses)
josh 10:02 AM

arielg 10:12 AM
@karelb let's discuss here rather than on github. I'm not sure I understand. What exactly is the sequence of commands that gives you a segfalt? I didn't understand what you meant by only with 0 confirmations
also, I think either @daira or @str4d told me once somewhere on this chat that it's just a linux measurement problem that memory doesn't go down after joinsplit
justin 10:21 AM
Can anyone point me to a discussion on STARKs? Someone told me, had STARKs be known earlier, Zcash would be using them.
karelb 10:22 AM
@arielg I sent money to myself, and the transaction had no confirmation. I wanted to send it away, so I used minconf=0 - otherwise, zcash doesn't let me send them
so I used `./zcash-cli z_sendmany zcJ9P29Ns4zEfNGY8oCKuCSdErgf2yBHDF4baAwrvvMKqrYJyxWmu76gHvwkZdTVWmZ2uaetk4TFCycQ33h2n1kVbkVPftQ '[{"address": "t1VnVfBEHdsLJ8L7kC9kyuWqgMs3351ZqG8", "amount": 0.4}]' 0`
the unconf transaction was shielded->shielded, where both were mine
oh wait no, it was shielded -> transparent, where the transparent was not mine and I waited for the change so I could spend more
akiron 10:28 AM
@miguel.marco I can't seem to find the qrcode package? Any info on that?
arielg 10:32 AM
@karelb so the tx you described above worked right? So what was it that gave you a segfault ?
karelb 10:33 AM
No, it did not work, that 0 conf gave me a segfault. It worked when the previous tx was confirmed and I didn't have the 0 at the end
arielg 10:34 AM
Ohh.. so it worked after there was at least 1 conf and you sent it without the 0 in the end?
karelb 10:34 AM
Spending unconfirmed input to shielded address gave me the segfault (repeatedly), once it was confirmed, it worked
yes
exactly
arielg 10:35 AM
Hmm this maybe an issue not related to the branch. Let's ask: @str4d @bitcartel - is it supposed to happen that user gets a segfault when trying to use a tx that has 0 confirmations? Isn't it better to give a more specific error message like "need to wait for at least 1 confirmations?"
karelb 10:36 AM
I cannot test it with master, since the ~signing~ proving won't fit in my memory 🙂 well I can try if it segfaults at least
arielg 10:36 AM
that would be great if you want to try that
Btw @karelb are you aware of running `zcash -regtest -daemon ` ? that allows you to test things without using real Zcash
karelb 10:40 AM
yeah I know regtest, that would not be a bad idea
I like to live dangerously!

@miguel.marco is there anything i can read on how pyzcto can be used to create a multi-sig wallet?
miguel.marco 2:07 PM
@akiron in the Readme file there is a section dedicated to it: https://github.com/miguelmarco/pyzcto#the-multisig-tab

    github.com
    miguelmarco/pyzcto
    pyzcto - A pyqt front end for the zcash wallet, and the companion of Zcash Pannel

BAsically, the workflow is as follows:
1) Collect one t-address from each signer (I recommend to create them specifically for a one-time use)
2) Put them in the Addresses/keys area of the Create/Import subtab, one per line
3) Select number of needed signatures (that is, if you want a 2-of-3 address, put three addresses and select 2 required signatures)
4) Click "Import to wallet", then you have the address included in your wallet
5) Copy the Redeem script and send it to the rest of the signers.
6) Each signer pastes the redeem script, the addresses and the number of requires signatures should appear so he can check it is ok
7) Each signer click "Import to wallet", now each signer has the multisig address included in his wallet
😎 Send funds to the multisig address, just as you would send to any other t-address
When somebody wants to spend funds from a multisig address, the "Sign/Send" subtab should be used. The workflow is this:
1) The signer that wants to spend must create a payment order: choose the multisig address to send from, and the addresses (and amounts) to send to
2) A payment order should appear, clicking "Sign" it should change to include the corresponding signature.
3) The payment order can be sent to other signer
4) The signers pastes the payment order. The data of the payment order (from address, to addresses and amounts), if he agrees to it, he can click "sign" and the payment order should change to include his signatures too.
5) The previous process of sending to a new signer and adding a new signature should be repeated until there are enough signatures. At that point, the "Broadcast" button should appear as enabled.
akiron 2:19 PM
ok, it seems to be failing on the Addresses/Keys step
I've added 3 transparent addresses, but the import to wallet line is greyed out
miguel.marco 2:20 PM
Sis you add one address per line, without blank spaces or any other characters?
Did you?
akiron 2:20 PM
as far as I can tell, there are no blank spaces or other characters
miguel.marco 2:21 PM
Does an address and Redeem script appear?
akiron 2:21 PM
no
miguel.marco 2:23 PM
Ok, then it seems that the addresses are detected as invalid
akiron 2:23 PM
they are t1 adresses
none of them are in my wallet on the local machine
miguel.marco 2:25 PM
try this on the command line interface:
zcash-cli createmultisig 2 "[\"t1...\", \"t1....\", \"t1...\"]"
does it show an address and redeem script?
akiron 2:28 PM
no, i get "no full public key for address t1....."
miguel.marco 2:29 PM
oh, i see.
Ok, try this: for each t1address, execute:
zcash-cli validateaddress "t1..."
in the node that has it included in the wallet
a "pubkey" field should appear
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:33 PM
@arielg it's a bit more complex than that. unused pages will eventually be paged out and the real memory backing them used for other processes. however misreporting the amount of memory used to the user is bad, and I believe also that the amount of memory reserved is used in OOM killer decisions
arielg June 8, 2017 10:13 AM
also, I think either @daira or @str4d told me once somewhere on this chat that it's just a linux measurement problem that memory doesn't go down after joinsplit
miguel.marco 2:35 PM
try pasting those pubkeys instead of the t1addresses in the "Addresses/keys" window
(It is my bad, I should include some option to extract the pubkey from the addresses, and change the documentation accordingly, will try to do it this weekend)
thanks for the testing! I missed that one
akiron 2:37 PM
yeah, ideally, i'd like a way to have each person running the wallet to press a button and get their pubkey
miguel.marco 2:38 PM
I will try to include it this summer. Do you think that a menu that appears with a right click on the "Addresses" tab would be a good UI?
Sorry, I meant this weekend
akiron 2:39 PM
yeah, i actually tried doing that
miguel.marco 2:39 PM
Ok. Will try to include it. In the meantime, you can use the cli to extract the pubkeys
(does that work that way?)
akiron 2:41 PM
i haven't tried that yet
miguel.marco 2:42 PM
ok, I think it should work, and now i understand the problem: the address includes the hash of the pubkey, so to create the multisig you need the pubkeys (the addresses are derived from them)
If the addresses are in your wallet, the pubkeys are stored, so you don't need them. But for addresses not in your wallet you need the pubkey

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:18 AM
@vonnegut.orwell The JSDescription is the shielded part of the transaction, so it *must* be created when the transaction is created.
(otherwise it would never be part of the transaction)

I truly don't like the blockchain technology unless it can be developed, because its such a slow process, imagine you waiting to pay for something, and you have to wait for someone to verify it on blockchain, my friend traded me his bitcoins and I am still waiting for it to be confirmed 2 weeks later, I truly believe that this process it too backdated we work on light and speed, click it's done!! not wait for someone to confirm and verify, too slow way to slow and that will crash under pressure when there are scores and scores of heavier traffic and volume, as is what's happening with the Kraken hahhahaa this has to improve drastically in order to accommodate it as a new form of currency

thoughts on zcoin?
name 8:06 AM
@jd zcoin and zcash stem from the same academic work, both have benefits and drawbacks, but looking at zcoin cap they definitely deserve more attention
people probably think its zcash fork
if they can get rid of that image through marketing they can grow
jd 8:07 AM
the founder of zcoin was a student under matthew green right?
name 8:08 AM
yes
he studied at the same uni as many of the zcash devs

yes
jd 8:10 AM

so from my understanding, zcash is an improvement over zcoin. but both still have their strengths and weaknesses?
name 8:19 AM
Personally I own both, I like the zerocash and zerocoin protocols
miguel.marco 8:33 AM
@akiron I pushed some further changes. I think now it should work, with the following precautions:
-1. The cosigners must send each other their public keys, paste them in the same order and set the same number of minimal signatures in order to create the same address (they can check the address to verify it is the same). The redeem script should be the same too, but with this workflow it is basically useless (i might even remove it in the future, since it may be confusing)
-2. When the multisig address is imported, the whole blockchain must be rescanned, which may take some time (a couple minutes in the testnet, so I would guess it will take even more in the mainnet). During that time, the program will be irresponsive (a dialog appears before that to warn about it). Apparently, this is part of the usual workflow with the command line, so i guess there is no way around it.
Let me know if it works for you

Is the User-Issued Token issue on Github the only place to track progress for that specific feature?
Also, can I help with it in any kind of way?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:18 AM
Hi @titano yes, I believe the team is still on track to release a User Issued token, the best way to contribute is to join the conversation on Github
Anyone can open or comment on issues, and they welcome contributions. What is your area of expertise?

What will be the main language for new releases? Is that Rust or C++?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:26 AM
I believe they recently started working with Rust, don't think is system wide yet, you would have to dig through the repo to see where it has been implemented
Perhaps @bitcartel would know better

Thanks, are you a Zcash developer also then?
Or do you other things in the community?

titano June 11, 2017 10:24 AM
What will be the main language for new releases? Is that Rust or C++?
most of the code base will remain in C++ for the foreseeable future though, barring any major new project to rewrite it
titano 1:56 PM
Hi @daira thanks, that clears it up!
So the User-Issued tokens feature will be written in C++. I don't write any C++, that's why I asked. 🙂

That not true(Daira), I have 2 paypal accounts they never asked for picture ID, I have had a Western Union account more than 22 years and they never ever asked me for ID, the only thing Paypal requested is verified by Visa it's the only thing they implemented, don't spread lies, and tbh the only time you need to use Id at western union is to collect the money or if sending more than 2000

As someone with a well-developed appreciation for cryptography and cyber-security, I am SUPER impressed with Zcash. Kudos all around for the crazy-outstanding work!
I appreciate that the current state of Zcash appeals to tech-savvy users (correct me if I'm wrong). That is a good starting point, before tackling the needs of a broader user base.
Given that the current "enthusiast" user base has a great appreciation for Zcash's unique value proposition, when will we see the exchanges support shielded addresses.
That would seem to be very important to the current users--this user especially--as moving funds from an exchange to my wallet via a transparent address starts one off on the "wrong" foot vis-a-vis Zcash's unique value proposition.
The ability to move funds from an exchange to my wallet via a shielded address starts one off on the "right" foot. From that point, I can transact from my wallet using either t-addrs or z-addrs as I see fit.

Hi @JvM yes the fact that currently Zcash private transactions take about 3GB of ram to perform is a reason that many pools and exchanges have not adopted private addresses
the team has been working on lowering the RAM requirements, last I heard they had been able to experiment as low as 50% less RAM use for a private transaction, I cant vouch for when it will be ready for the public, but hopefully soon
there is also a project called payment-offloading that would allow for separate servers to most of the heavy computation and allow for lite clients on phones and such https://z.cash/blog/the-near-future-of-zcash.html

I don't get why this system that was hopefully invented to alleviate all these semantics, has now become an even more complicated platform
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:40 PM
The complexity of zkSNARKS are the main reason, if it was easy to create transactions that can be verified on a blockchain but still provide the best privacy ever seen in a protocol, everyone would be doing it 😉
thefmgirl 4:44 PM
I believe in my Zcash so much, that I honestly believe something great has to happen, because this money has to go to the top of the food chain!!
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:49 PM
There is a reason that the releases have been named "sprout" and sapling" , the team is continuously improving the efficiency of the protocol and adding new features like Cross-chain transactions, User issued tokens, etc.. this is still a young coin and community with lots of room to grow 🌳

In the same picture have a reference to Bitfinex and today's date displayed — a note with the word 'Bitfinex', today's date, and your signature will do. Make sure your face will be clearly visible and that all passport details are clearly readable.

Face clearly visible

2 pieces of ID and proof of residence!!!!! 😲😲😲😱
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:37 PM
That's not all that different to the bank
You go in person to the bank, so they get far more contextual data that is hard to fake than an over-the-internet interaction
Namely, your face at various angles, today's date, your signature, the fact you are actively interacting with them
thefmgirl 6:38 PM
So my question is WHERE IS YOUR COMPANY??? WHO IS securing my data, what security do you offer for my identification, who had access to it??
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:38 PM
Right, that's a very pertinent question
But separate to their need for that data in the first place
thefmgirl 6:39 PM
Where will my info be, who is collecting this?? is your servers where actutally??? what protection are you offering me when I send you all this personal life information
the social security office had a breech, I was sent a letter sorry to inform you but our computers were stolen with your information on it. Please contact the police to file a report for protection against identity theft, imagine a government office, so WHAT security can this company offer me, WHO are they??? WHO is your staff where is my information going???? I know the address of the bank!!! but now you want all my information how secure is it???wow
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:46 PM
That comes down to what the company puts in their ToS and Privacy Policy. If you don't think their particular policy is sufficient protection, there's not much to do other than take your business elsewhere

I use the some method that the bitcoin is use to generate the script sig.
It works in LTC but not in zcash. I think I must missing something in the progress.

Could somebody help me learn how to recover data from backup files?

I did "backupwallet" and "z_exportwallet" accordingly with "wallet-backup.md" on GitHub.
Then I prepared another machine and did "cp ${backup_wallet_result_file} ~/.zcash/wallet.dat" and "zcashd --daemon; zcash-cli z_importwallet".

Still "zcash-cli getinfo" returns "balance: 0".
It seems to be failing...

My storage is still alive, but wanna train it before real emergency.
BTW "zcash-cli listtransaction" returns empty.
Oh, I did it while my original zcashd server is running. Could it cause this situation?
No...not solved after stopping the original server.

im just trying to figure out how to send x amount of coin to a friend
from my zaddr to his taddr, or from my taddr to his taddr
icky 1:25 PM
an example command and its output would be useful, probably for a lot of people if it were in the documentation as well
miguel.marco 1:25 PM
zcash-cli z_sendmany your_address "[{\"address\":\"your_friends_address\", \"amount\":amount_to_send }]"
icky 1:25 PM
👍
miguel.marco 1:26 PM
I would recommend to use a GUI anyways
icky 1:26 PM
@miguel.marco that will send from my zaddr to a taddr?
miguel.marco 1:27 PM
yes, any combination of t/z addresses
icky 1:27 PM

    vaklinov/zcash-swing-wallet-ui
    zcash-swing-wallet-ui - ZCash Desktop GUI Wallet

miguel.marco 1:27 PM
In that case, the cli will probably have to wait for the indexing too
icky 1:28 PM
@miguel.marco i backed up my ~/.zcash dir before loading the GUI, so i can fallback if i need to
miguel.marco 1:29 PM
both vaklinov's and mine ( https://www.github.com/miguelmarco/pyzcto ) are just front ends for the rpc interface, just as the cli

Hi I have a doubt. I just installed nheqminer and run it. But the main question do I put the Bitcoin wallet address or the Zcash wallet address. If I do nheqminer.exe -h it says bitcoin address but in some forums I was reading people put the Zcash wallet address. I just want to make sure im doing right.

@joncc There will be wider adoption of Z_addresses when the team upgrades the protocol to use less memory. Right now it takes about 3GB for a JoinSplit operation, they have been able to experiment with 50% reduction in that number.
joncc 6:24 AM
any timeline?
also while i have you here, whats the current avg time it takes to send a transaction? and what is the target time? thanks 🙂

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:26 AM
It usually takes seconds to receive a transaction depending on the network
But as with Bitcoin it takes a number of confirmations of the network. Zcash requires 100 confirmations for coinbase funds to be spent.
joncc 6:28 AM
what is zcash's plan to alleviate longer confirmation times in the near future?
i mean its pretty fast now
but currently supply is also very low
sorry im a bit of a newb and github is not easy for me to navigate
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:29 AM
@mineZcash there is no requirement for confirmations on general transactions at present
It comes down to user evaluation of risk
The 100 confirmation restriction is for coinbase to be spendable
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:30 AM
@zorrow you can see if your node is fully synced by checking the block height of your node
joncc 6:30 AM
ah ok
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:30 AM
Ah, I stand corrected
joncc 6:30 AM
does sending to a z address take longer than to a t?
for coins to be spendable that is
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:31 AM
The simplistic confirmation "security level" would be 24 confirmations, because the Zcash block interval is 1/4 of Bitcoin's, and Bitcoin recommend 6 confirmations
joncc 6:31 AM
so its 24 vs 100?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:31 AM
But it's a little more complex than that, because simply allowing 1 hour in both cases is not quite equivalent, because 24 blocks are more likely to be closer to the expected average interval than 6
Yay statistics

Also @freya you can read about what makes Zcash unique to other coins here https://www.zcashcommunity.com/technology/

    www.zcashcommunity.com

joncc 6:34 AM
ok let me work this out,
100 confirmations is required for coins to be spendable
24 confirmations is required for coins to show up on chain
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:34 AM
@joncc no
joncc 6:34 AM
and sending to a z address compared to a t address has no difference in time required for for spendable coins to appear?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:34 AM
100 confirmations are required for coinbase (ie mined) coins to be spendable
0 confirmations are required for transaction outputs to show up on chain
Same as Bitcoin
(whether they *stay* on-chain is another question, and what "number of confirmations" is usually used to refer to)
joncc 6:36 AM
ok
i understood about half of that
maybe you could dumb it down for me, does sending to a z address take longer than sending to a t address
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:36 AM
ie. when a site wants e.g. 3 confirmations on Bitcoin, they want 3 blocks mined on top of the one containing the transaction
joncc 6:36 AM
simply a yes or no answer
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:36 AM
This is the same as for Bitcoin
@joncc you did ask several questions at once
joncc 6:37 AM
i know my apologies
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:37 AM
For your third question, no, sending to a z-address takes no longer than a t-address
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:37 AM
Also keep in mind (as far as scaling goes) that Zcash has twice the block size and 4 times the block interval of Bitcoin, so 8x the transaction throughput.
joncc 6:37 AM
i apprecaite the both of you taking time to help
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:37 AM
(at present)
joncc 6:37 AM
ok
so more transactions can be handled
nice
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:38 AM
Transactions involving z-addresses are larger than ones involving t-addresses, but the default mining policy does prefer JoinSplit-containing transactions
joncc 6:38 AM
maybe more of a philosophical question here, does zcash wish to supplement bitcoin or take over
i promise i wont spread fud with this answer
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:39 AM
Co-exist and co-operate!
joncc 6:39 AM
got cha
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:39 AM
I think there is room for many coins in the crypto currency space
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:39 AM
See for example one of our ongoing projects - Project Alchemy - for enabling decentralized exchanging of Zcash for Bitcoin and/or Ethereum
joncc 6:40 AM
is that using zk-snark on eth or etc chain thing ive been hearing/reading about?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:41 AM
No, this is different
joncc 6:41 AM
@mineZcash hmm, but can zec, xmr, and dash all exist when each provides more or less the same function?
just some tea time talk 😉
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:42 AM
There are three separate Zcash+Ethereum things:
- Enabling zk-SNARKs to be used in Ethereum contracts.
- Adding privacy-preserving smart contracts to Zcash (e.g. BOLT).
- Project Alchemy: decentralized exchange of ZEC with ETH.

Nice no bullshit pool, you have an account and can see your earnings.
Too expensive @thefmgirl for real profit. Better of buying coins imo
thefmgirl 6:03 PM
I been trying to buy coins one month the only one I want is Zcash and to this day, the only site selling it is Kraken and I am waiting 1 month to be approved
or verified according to them
so no coins for me, just wanting on bs from NEW seller sites and their BS methods
chris6 6:04 PM
Yeah ok, i have an idea if you want it now. there is a site called virwox
you can deposit money into it using paypal
thefmgirl 6:05 PM
serious exactly what I am seeking
they sell Zcash ZEC
chris6 6:06 PM
then transfer USD to SLL, then SLL to BTC, then you have bitcoin you can trade for ZEC on a site like Bittrex.
sounds confusing but it works. and is simple.
your first withdrawl from virwox may take 1 day. and there are fees at every step. you may lose $20+ once you have ZEC
after your 1st withdrawal from virwox they are all instant.
So just something to think about. I have done it many times.
Bittrex don't require I.D also. they trade only crypto and not fiat.
ezegom 6:11 PM
I do the same.. buy BTC then transfer it to bittrex to buy other cryptos
it works really well

ezegom 6:18 PM
yeah, transactions are quick
chris6 6:18 PM
Hope i've managed to help you. keep kraken going but virwox is a nice alternative.
thefmgirl 6:18 PM
no backlog means they are prepared hehehee
I like that
I dont like Kraken
I told them delete my account because they dont even respond to your messages
chris6 6:19 PM
you will need it in case zec hits $500,000 so you can withdraw to fiat.
try poloniex then.
virwox is high fee's + more fee's.
good for small amounts to get you started.
how will they delete your account if they're not responding? I've heard they have a backlog and you would need to be patient.
thefmgirl 6:23 PM
hahahhaa
and this is the future hahahha
they not even equipt to handle today much less for the volume tomorrow will bring
poloniex dont sell ZEC
or I forgot buy bitcoin
chris6 6:25 PM
Yeah exactly.
bittrex is a very good site.
You will be fine. just stay away from all those crypto gambling sites.

this wont allow for generating zec wallets, as i ave no actual idea how it differs from bitcoin address generation, so i was unale to make a edit to the crypto core of the site

I would like to put one up, maybe with some nice graphics etc, when I get some free time I'll dig into it
do you mean you don't know how Zcash addresses differ from bitcoin?

no, i meanthat the address generation is different
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:00 PM
yeah, especially when it comes to z_addresses
optictick 3:00 PM
the address generator on the site has a algo that is used to generate different addresses, it only works with addresses that are generated the same way that bitcoin address is
but as zec address is longer, the code wont work on it, and i dont quite crasp the algo behind the address generation

thanks @radix42 @mineZcash but it doesn't fully detail the privacy model. For instance, t->z anybody sees who t is of course, but people don't know who z is,except for the owner of z who does see this as coming from t. It would be useful to have a document that's not as detailed as the full protocol specification, but more precise than "anatomy of a zcash transaction"

@tromer it's visible on the metrics screen, but maybe not in some external wallets. That would be a feature request for those wallets rather than zcashd, though

I wish we had an indication, within the daemon/wallet, when this sync is done.
tromer Zcash Foundation 11:29 AM
@daira, the metrics screen shows the block height the wallet is synced up to, but not the current block height of the network.
So users are forced to compare this number to what's shown by some block explorer website, or to just wait until the numbers seem to stop incrementing. Both are unreliable and bad UX.

Good point. I'm not sure that the current P2P protocol easily allows getting a reliable indication of the current block height, though. Block explorers do it by running continuously, which by definition a zcashd that is catching up has not done

Hi there? I have a problem and I need you help. I have sent 6.9999 ZEC from my Kraken account to my Ledger wallet ZEC address t1NRmRQM4WdArjiSGdBLo5Gmaww2qvaE2U1, “success” status on Kraken side but ZEC tokens never arrived in my Ledger wallet. And I think this is because of me or, which is more correct, because of badly designed Ledger Nano S ZEC UX: after sending ZEC from Kraken I was in my Bitcoin Ledger wallet Chrome app and suddenly received a message on my Ledger Nano S device “Confirm address ******” which had no meaning for me because I was in BTC wallet, did non initiate any transactions in it, so I thought that maybe I am under some kind of attack and I clicked No on Ledger Nano S. Now I think that the message probably was related to my ZEC transfer but I could not possibly understand it from what I got on my Ledger Nano S which asked me to confirm some address without any other details. Is there any way I can get my tokens now or they are lost forever? Thanks!
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:57 AM
@misharo I don't have any experience with Ledger, so I can't help you directly, but as long as the Ledger wallet address is in fact from the device (have you used it successfully before?) then the funds should be recoverable because the address should be derived from an internal seed.
misharo 6:59 AM
Yes, the address is correct but I have no idea what to do now 😞
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:59 AM
Best to ask the Ledger people
misharo 7:00 AM
I think ZEC developers have to speak with Ledger developers to improve the UX, otherwise people will be losing trust in ZEC transactions. Thanks
misharo 7:07 AM
One more question: how long it usually takes the transaction to reach the destination address? I have just realised that this address confirmation message has nothing to do with my ZEC transfer, that was just a security check related to my BTC address. So, if Kraken says "success" but I have not received the tokens on my ZEC address, where can they be? Still mining? I am not sure how it works in ZEC, this is my first and I hope not the last experience with it
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:08 AM
Works the same way as with any other Bitcoin-derived currency; transaction enters the mempool, and then gets mined in
There's relatively little pressure comparatively at the moment, so it should be mined relatively quickly (blocks are every 2.5 minutes)
Best way to check is to look on Kraken for a transaction ID, and check in a block explorer
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:09 AM
It usually takes me less than 5min for a ZEC transaction to show up on the Block explorer

chris6 7:12 AM
It's there @misharo I can see it 🙂
6.9999 ZEC is sitting in the address you sent it too.
you will be fine.
misharo 7:13 AM
Hmmm... So strange that I don't see them in my Ledger wallet. Sent them an email, hope I'll be fine. Thanks guys, you are the best 🙂
chris6 7:15 AM
It (should) show eventually. forget how the ledger stores it's private keys and weather you can see them or not. but you will be fine.
misharo 7:18 AM
is there something wrong with how they store them? should I worry?
chris6 7:20 AM
no, it's very secure the way they store them.
and reliable from my experience with the bitcoin only version.
do you have the little black card?
misharo 7:23 AM
nope. I have ledger nano S, not nano. I have a card with a seed but I will not tell you :))
chris6 7:24 AM
damn, i mean, sure you can tell me 🙂
anyway, your fine. you have the seed.
misharo 7:25 AM
thanks 🙂
chris6 7:26 AM
no worries, coins are there 🙂
good job make sure you hold onto them for a long time!

guess ill just state my problem.. I'm running a gtx 180 ti FE (msi) overclocked to +175 on the gpu core and +500 on the ram and its stable
ive tried NiceHashMiner_v1.7.5.13, EWBF Zec Miner 0.3.4b, and Windows_x64_nheqminer-5c.zip
last night using NiceHash I was getting in the range of 670-700 sols/s then it clocked down and wouldnt go over 300 sols/s and my card never goes over 180 w power usage
despite maintaining its full o/c
now no matter which pool i try, or which miner I can't get back to the performance of the card i know it can do

Anyone have any tips and tricks or issues running zcash in production?
working on running a node for ingesting the zcash blockchain into ipfs
It hasnt been causing any trouble so far, just wondering if anyone has any advice
kevin 5:33 PM
@whyrusleeping i recommend running under systemd, putting mainnet.z.cash and network.zcha.in under addnode and increasing maxconnections to whatever is the max on your system
example systemd service unit with some hardening applied:

```
[Unit]
Description=Zcash daemon
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=zcash
Group=zcash

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

whyrusleeping 5:34 PM
@kevin ah great, thanks 🙂
Currently running in a docker container
with autorestart set
@radix42 yeah, most of the parsing code is here: https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-zcash

    github.com
    ipfs/go-ipld-zcash
    go-ipld-zcash - An implementation of the zcash block and transaction datastructures for ipld

then this sketchy bit of go code pulls blocks from the zcashd into ipfs https://github.com/whyrusleeping/ipfs-import-chain

    github.com
    whyrusleeping/ipfs-import-chain
    ipfs-import-chain - A tool to import data from zcash or bitcoin into ipfs (requires a special ipfs build)

@radix42 yeah, it is
currently it requries patching ipfs
sweet 🙂
i also have bindings for bitcoin and ethereum
and git
s/bindings/parsers/ i guess
definitely, as long as the block format is the same
then yep, works perfectly fine with any of them
lol
i'm gonna try and make it a simple go plugin, so you can just download a 'zcash plugin' for ipfs, put it in a certain directory, and then restart ipfs
and then it will have support
similar to how minecraft plugins work
minus the sketchy java and weird mod sites
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:43 PM
@whyrusleeping does this control funds / private keys?
-or is it just parsing public blockchain info?
whyrusleeping 5:43 PM
just parsing public blockchain info
though unfortunately, to get that info it needs api access
which gives it access to your keys
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:44 PM
Ok. One known operational hurdle for z-addr wallets is that the scanning cost increases with the number of z-addrs.
Oh, then I wouldn't put keys on that node.
whyrusleeping 5:44 PM
Yeah, scanning the blockchain for address info all happens through ipfs
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:45 PM
Hm, actually you might be able to build without the wallet if you don't want it available. I'm not familiar with that, though.
I mean, other than seeing the build option, I've never experimented with that.
whyrusleeping 5:45 PM
hrm... that would be interesting
something i would be really interested in would be replacing the block/tx database with ipfs
but thats a much larger endeavour

Where are you receiving the payout from? or are you sending?
ehigiepaul 4:04 PM
payout from antpool and sending to wirex
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:05 PM
does Antpool give you a transaction ID?
ehigiepaul 4:06 PM
no transaction id for the payout
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:07 PM
then it probably hasn't been sent, have you mined enough to meet the minimum payout?
Are you sure Wirex supports Zcash?
ehigiepaul 4:09 PM
yes is have passed the minimum payout
yes from the app i got a zcash account to pay to
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:10 PM

no i cant
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:11 PM
has it ever received a payment?

wirex has from my bitcoin account
am testing every method of transfer so i can educate people on zcash
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:12 PM
ok, well if you cant see it in the explorer the it likely has never received any Zcash, I would suggest contacting Antpool to figure out why payment has not been sent
ehigiepaul 4:13 PM
will do
thanks

Yes, once your node re-connects it should be able to send
Use `sudo apt-get install zcash=1.0.9`

^ That assumes you originally installed using apt-get
If you built from source, then the procedure is different, is that the case?

Question, how to buy with the zcash something if there are too few of it.
Why do you make the difficulty so high
Your founders have earned your money, but what about miners?
tromer Zcash Foundation 9:21 AM
@tuux, the mining difficulty is automatically adjusted by the network, to keep the block interval stable (2.5 minutes on average). Just like in Bitcoin and other proof-of-work blockchains.
So the reason the difficulty is high is that many miners are putting resources into mining Zcash; and that's a good thing for network stability and security.

@tuxx: miners always have the opportunity to mine other GPU-friendly coins if they find that Zcash gives them less return than those coins. if they weren't getting any return, they wouldn't mine at all
also, the rise in difficulty has not been especially sharp: https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/timeseries?supply=false&trnstx=false&shldtx=false

I want to discuss something
or rather open a discussion about zcash and its acceptance on Alphabay
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:53 AM
_listens_
nomadic_somali 1:55 AM
1. Adoption of Zcash on alphabay will increase its market cap. Agree or Disagree? Also, why?
2. Adoption of Zcash on alphabay will place it under greater scrutiny as a currency for drug deals. Agree? Disagree?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 1:56 AM
it would be difficult to separate the influence of alphabay adoption from other factors affecting the market cap. note that market cap = supply * price, and the monetary supply schedule is fixed, so we're really just talking about price here
I think it's inevitable that private cryptocurrencies in general will come under greater scrutiny. I also think we're winning the argument that privacy is absolutely necessary
nomadic_somali 1:58 AM

please note that although I work for ZcashCo, my opinions are my own

nomadic_somali 2:06 AM

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:06 AM
for a long time I've been involved in security research, particularly in capability-based security
there's a project called Tahoe-LAFS (https://tahoe-lafs.org), which is a distributed file store using cryptographic capabilities. Zooko was one of the main developers on that project, so that's how I got to know him

    tahoe-lafs.org
    Tahoe-LAFS

and then when Zooko launched a company to provide commercial file storage service using Tahoe-LAFS (https://leastauthority.com), I joined that

    leastauthority.com
    Home | Least Authority
    Least Authority was formed in 2011 to create freedom-compatible technologies. We are a small team who believe that freedom matters in Internet technology. You can take advantage of online services while retaining control over your own data. We're here to make it easy.

Zcash was Zooko's next project after that, so I became involved with it at an early stage. I was already involved with cryptographic research (e.g. the SPHINCS post-quantum signature scheme, which Zooko is a co-designer of), so it was a natural progression
nomadic_somali 2:11 AM

that such things exist

nomadic_somali 2:15 AM
you've spent considerable time working on projects that focus on privacy (correct me if i'm wrong)
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:15 AM
yes
nomadic_somali 2:15 AM
why? what is it about privacy that makes it such a priority for you ?
again, no obligation to answer
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 2:18 AM
it's always been a political issue for me. I got into cryptography in general around the time when the US government were trying to suppress systems like PGP, and the cypherpunks were opposing that (although I don't really consider myself an old-time cypherpunk)...
it seemed to me quite obvious that it should be possible for people to organize and communicate privately, and that to do so was a necessary response to centralizing influences of state power and capitalism...
(I didn't think of myself as an anarchist then, as I do now, but I had many of the same political opinions)
since then, those centralizing influences have only got worse and have increased the oppression of marginalized people (LGBT, people of colour, immigrants, etc.) It's necessary to resist them, and private communication is a critical tool in doing so

    🙌 1 

that must include financial privacy, since as long as we live under a system that values money as much as our current society does, and oppresses people on the basis of how much money they have or how they use it...
weaknesses in financial privacy will translate into more general privacy violations

Zcash Pool scam
Hello dear miner, I have found the following
And it is strangely simply the hashrate set down for a long time when the blockdifficult drops, when it rises it is again adjusted, or more miner had come into the pool with pps/pplns it is synonymous
hubot Robot 12:25 PM
Well hello there, tuxx
tuxx 12:30 PM
Also good to be observed is to register with a pool, pay it on the first day much and from the second day up to 30% less, announces itself then with new ip address and new worker with new zcash address one sees it again
Next example, you should get 0.05 zec on the day with slight deviations, then the pool is in luck and you have reached 0.05 already after 12 hours, the next payments go down significantly and quite clearly until the day is finished
Everything under consideration the pool hashrate and block difficult

shielding is compulsory.

If you're on Flypool, consider switching to some other pool https://explorer.zcha.in/statistics/miners because, it's making the currency unsafe. Though I do understand they have a lot to lose, since they make like $20k a day just as a pool

chris6 3:33 AM
I feel that will change in the near future as more coins are minted. The technology is still evolving.
Theoretically, The anonymity of a z-addr is near perfect.
hence alphabay.
I am predicting they will have z-addr deposit.
sharpy 3:49 AM
It's really surprising to me that they didn't do it yet. I'm sure it would also be surprising to most of zcash users would they even be aware.
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:57 AM
More users will adopt z-addresses as they become easier to use. For now you have to install a full node and be comfortable with the Zcash RPC to generate and receive private funds.
chris6 3:58 AM
that ^

As the team incorporates the payment offloading protocol and reduces the amount of RAM required this will allow lite wallets like Jaxx to begin incorporating private addresses. That's when we will really see increased use.

    It is also worth noting that fewer connections are considered to be better for privacy and anonymity than more connections, in terms of the network effect. Satoshi thought that having 8 connections was 'optimal' for Bitcoin P2P (in terms of the network), broadcasting transactions and user privacy etc,. Setting maxconnections= 6 (or even to 4) in your zcash.conf might be advisable for clients who are seeking increased anonymity, for example.

    I'll try to make this as concise as possible without losing too much accuracy: Value is carried by "notes" which specify an amount and a public key. To each note there is cryptographically associated a commitment, and a nullifier (so that there is a 1:1:1 relation between notes, commitments, and nullifiers). However, it is not possible to correlate a commitment with its nullifier without knowledge of the note. Computing the nullifier requires the associated private key. An unspent valid note, ...

I believe the DNS seeder/crawler gives those stats. Running zcash-dnsseed indicates there are roughly around 15,200 nodes out there. only like 290 of them are open and not behind NAT.
make that more than 16,000... I have it still running and it's discovering more.,
ok, it seems to have stopped incrementing. 15733 is the most exact number I have at the present time 😛
not bad

Ok guys...speculator in the house...bought 5k worth zcash and expect price to touch 1500 by aug end once its on alphabay for a couple of months...is this possible? Help will be appreciated...cheers!
chris6 2:05 AM
No one can say. define:speculation. Anything is possible. $1500 is a huge jump and unlikely.
Could touch $30 again.
I have a feeling it "MAY" happen, followed but a sharp drop in price.

Anyone know if there are any Banks that accept Bitcoin-Zcash?
crypto.world 7:02 AM
I use Trezor "Cold Storage" wallet , wanting to set up a Banking account to transfer Bitcoin-Zcash converting into fiat or ideally use my crypto coins to access other Banking services such as using my crypto as collateral for loan/ property loans ect. Currently to my knowledge there are ATM's that accept Bitcoins & to a lesser extent Zcash , however they are only useful for buying/selling . I've heard Brazilians can pay utility Bills with Zcash so I'm assuming linking our crypto wallets to direct Banking accounts isn't far away?

@kevin yes, fairly straightforward
Note that not all of the Base58 character set is possible for the third byte (after "zc" for a mainnet z-address)
Also, we'll probably change the address derivation in Sapling in a way that will require using elliptic curve arithmetic to search for the address (currently you only need SHA-256 to produce a vanity first half of the address)

interesting. got it

mineZcash Admin Owner 2:53 PM
Boils down to two old arguments: "it's too new" so we are going to keep using yesterday's crypto (why try to innovate at all?) and "it has a trusted setup that we didn't directly participate in" so it _must_ have been "compromised" somehow. Neither argument you can win against someone who has already made up thier mind. 🙄
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:07 PM
I also don't see any mention of the limitations of the CT protocol ie: "The tiny amount of information about the value leaked in this way is unlikely to be important, but be aware that this could allow observers to ‘follow’ coins by linking subsequent transactions with identical amounts" , I suppose they forgot to mention that.. https://elementsproject.org/elements/confidential-transactions/

True enough. Each approach has it's own strengths and weaknesses, I just disagree with the notion that Zcash tech is somehow "inferior". People in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

miguel.marco 4:50 PM
I think the concern about the trusted setup is legitimate. And also the usability problems derived from the high computational cost of shielded transactions.
The rest of the criticism makes no sense: the privacy level provided by zcash is superior to CT by far.

okay, fuck, why does Zcash point to freewallet wallet (instead of warning against it) with the conversation on reddit (millions REPORTED lost, more millions lost), even fluffy from Monero said it was a scam, and google play didn't remove that shit ... freewallet did the extra step to deprive you from the the key, and it look like from July reviews on google play, they just steal money, wait for your ticket
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:12 PM
@usair I had heard of rumors about Freewallet but nothing definitive
usair 6:13 PM

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:30 PM
From the comments on Google Play and even the thread you linked the majority of the issues seemed to be linked with ETH transactions and network issues.
Unless you can provide something more definitive I will leave the link up, it is always up to users to do thier homework before trusting services with thier coins.
I don't personally use lite wallets, only Linux full node and cold storage, but I can see the appeal.

just installed the linux gui client and it has been running for about 2 hours and has only synced .35% of the blockchain
are their any tricks to make it go faster? i have a windows wallet on another machine and it had no problems syncing
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:14 AM
the entire chain is about 5GB, depending on your DL speed it can take awhile
recklessop 11:15 AM
ive got a 30Mbps pipe
it says not connected to any peers right now too
any way to edit the peer list and maybe add my windows desktop as a peer ?
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:16 AM
it wont connect to peers until it is fully synced
recklessop 11:16 AM
oh gotcha.
can i copy the blockchain from windows to linux ?
save the network some BW too
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:17 AM
I would like there to be some sort of checkpoint to DL, but one of the reasons it take awhile the first time is because its also verifying the chain, the devs havent implemented a way to check chain integrity from a checkpoint yet

Re: transferring a chain state from another machine, I think that might cause problems because it's assumed that the state of the wallet database is consistent with the rest of the chain state
This is something we need to consider carefully in the Database Improvement project
What you should be able to do is transfer the contents of the .zcash directory other than wallet.dat, and then start zcashd with -reindex on the next run
(-reindex is quite slow but definitely not as slow as a sync from scratch)
Anyway, it's a serious usability bug that you even have to think about when to reindex, IMHO. It should just work
But cache invalidation is one of the two hard problems in computer science, so...
(Admittedly, this *shouldn't* be a particularly difficult case of that hard problem.)

isotope 3:19 PM
what mean "Difficulty" in ZEC mining, tell me pls)
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:25 PM
@isotope Difficulty is automatically set by the number of miners competing for Zcash blocks. The goal is to maintain the target block interval of 2.5min
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:57 PM
To be more precise it's set according to the interval between the median block times of two 11-block windows, 17 blocks apart
This is related to the total network hash rate, but the latter can't be directly measured, only estimated

See section 6.4.3 'Difficulty adjustment' in the protocol spec

Also note that in our case, statically linking with libstdc++ wouldn't be sufficient to solve the issue with system gcc version unless we also statically linked with libgomp (for OpenMP support). But if you statically link {libstdc++, libgomp} but not {libgcc, libc, libpthreads, libm}, you're really playing with fire because libgomp heavily depends on pthreads and you're likely mixing library versions that have never been tested together

Quick question on patents. How do you guys think that ZeroDB's patent on Zero Knowledge Databases will influence the usage and development of Zcash? https://www.google.com/patents/US9519798

    www.google.com
    Patent US9519798 - Zero-knowledge databases
    Provided is a process of operating a zero-knowledge encrypted database, the process including: obtaining a request for data in a database stored by an untrusted computing system, wherein the database is stored in a graph that includes a plurality of connected nodes, each of the nodes including: an identifier, accessible to the untrusted computing system, that distinguishes the respective node from other nodes in the graph; and an encrypted collection of data stored in encrypted form, wherein: the untrusted computing system does not have access to an encryption key to decrypt the collections of data, the encrypted collections of data in at least some of the plurality of nodes each include a plurality of keys indicating subsets of records in the database accessible via other nodes in the graph and corresponding pointers to identifiers of the other nodes.

@anno An interesting question. I could imagine not enforceable in EU because of lacking integral physical embodiment. Something to read about: http://www.ecfr.eu/digitalpower/blog/the_european_software_patent_conundrum_what_to_do_7179.

you need a psysical competent?
wouldn't the patent be dependent on the patent of bitcoin itself
to use as a crypto
or are slightly different crypto technologies sidestep that issue

mineZcash Admin Owner 1:23 PM
Hi @iamjes I'm afraid not, you best bet will be to use your GPU and join a pool
iamjes 1:24 PM
so running the node today does it help the network at all?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:28 PM
yes, running a node helps the network and verifies transactions and the node also has a built in wallet that will let you spend Zcash
iamjes 1:28 PM
while i am using my gpu ill still run the node with 1 cpu core
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:29 PM
or receive Zcash, its just that the hashpower on the whole network is so high that the basic CPU miner is not enough to really have a chance to find a block

@lunat1c remember that your coins are on the Blockchain, not "in" a wallet. The only things we can control are the public and private keys to spend those coins. Poloniex has your public and private keys, so as long as they don't delete your keys (they won't because they would lose millions) then any funds sent to that address will be there when the wallet is synced to the chain.

    👍 1 

This is another reason not to trust third parties with your keys, if they disappear one day and you don't have a backup of the private keys, the funds are lost forever.

Hi.
May be someone can help here, cause dev chat seems to be silent for now.
I'm looking for any strict specification for zcash solver i.e., strict definition of task, that solver must compute.
I'm already found few open-source solvers, including some, that tends to be "reference". But it's somehow hard to reconstruct initial task from them.
Is there any datasheet / reference etc. that describes initial input and goal, that not describes someone's implementation? Thank you.

I've been involved in a very lengthy discussion about Zcash vs Monero. Now they have the advantage with their community just bashing whoever makes a technical comparison with Zcash. There are multiple venues of discussion: reddit and github.

hi
I can't find the test vectors that were available for the zcash challenge (link is dead, can't find them on github), anyone has an idea of where I could find them?
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:05 PM
@l.p. are you reffering to the open miners challenge? https://zcashminers.org/

    zcashminers.org
    Zcash Open Source Miners | Home
    On October 28, 2016, the launch of Zcash will make ZEC coins available for mining. Since Zcash is an open source, decentralized cryptocurrency, we believe that mining should be available to everyone, regardless of their access to specialized hardware; anyone should be able to use a computer to “mine” by using open source software, and add more transactions to the Zcash ledger to get Zcash coins in return for their effort. By distributing the ability to perform mining, the Zcash network can be a more accessible and a truly community supported cryptocurrency.

@zooko I seem to gathered around that BitTrex is becoming more popular, but thanks for the response. Still at this moment I've noticed its not just Zcash thats temporarily disabled on Polo, it is 6 different crypto. I wonder if Polo is adding a Zcash market like Eth has. May be the reason the 5 other coins are currently disabled as well.

Yeah ETH deposit/withdrawal was offline for a while on Polo with no clear explanation. Just &quot;network instability&quot;. I think they&#39;re having staffing issues following a massive surge in new users. It&#39;s a shame, cos Polo is definitely my favourite interface.

@asusx and @ any others that are concerned. I was able to use Poloniex to exchange Zcash to another crypto.

I now see why it is said not to use exchanges as a mining wallet.
mr.tinker 7:19 PM
@foodforthought @mineZcash I just find it interesting that its 6 different coins at once. If it was a surge in the ZEC market, why would it bother the 5 other coins? Bytecoin, Bitmark, Einsteinium, Riecoin, and Vcash, are the other coins I speak of.

oh so if i focused on mining Zcash, it would be a better idea to open a zcash wallet and send my mine transactions there

@KrasheR @wegg It has been over a month since i have used JAXX, so i can not say what the fees are. The Linux version i used did not work well with my distro. I will say it is safe like wegg stated, i just had issues running it on my Linux distro.

KrasheR 10:11 PM
but i am testing 1 1080ti on my gaming pc and i tried nicehash, it seems my returns are low 4$ roughly. But with zcash i am having a higher sol's and returns roughly at 5.5 to 6ish $ a day , thats without overclock just standard mine
i am assuming if i overclock it and make it run to a higher performance i would be getting 7-8ish $?
wow 24$ from how many cards?
mr.tinker 10:13 PM
@KrasheR Have you tried using EWBF's miner? It seems to be optimized for Nvidia.
KrasheR 10:13 PM
never heard of it. i only tried claymore , nicehash, zcash miner. thats it
the past 4 days since i just got to know about mining
been trying to catch up with this mining 😛
wegg 10:15 PM
I think 1080ti cards net about 700 Sol/s?
KrasheR 10:15 PM
yes 700-750
wegg 10:15 PM
So you'd be at about 4800 Sol/s
KrasheR 10:16 PM
with 6 yes
mr.tinker 10:16 PM
I have one thats 1050 ti that gets 170 Sol/s using EWBF, where as others was about 20 or so lower.
wegg 10:16 PM
So that's $14 a day at today's difficulty and price point.

i have 2 pc's next time with 970, and they are giving me 280 sol/s

@AngryTowelie You can still exchange ZEC to other currency on the markets. I can not confirm with jaxx/shapeshift at the moment, but it should be possible to exchange to another crypto on Poloniex. Then withdraw to Jaxx, followed by shapeshift back to Zcash.

@fr-mi you can still mine Zcash, just use another wallet. Also, nicehash pools pay you in bitcoin but you are mining for zcash.

@wegg I use Linux, EWBF miner, and have used Nicehash pool

I'm trying dual mining with Claymore at the moment. . . but. . . results are. . . still not as good as just EWBF mining Zcash.
wait so you just point EWBF to the Nicehash pool and it spits out bitcoin?
mr.tinker 1:53 AM
Make sure you have a Bitcoin wallet, and yes. Where it is Linux I edit the .cfg file and add the stratum port, along with my bitcoin wallet address.

Otherwise I can't pay my phone bills.
I have 50$ of Zec stuck on my flypool.

can't you just exchange your ZEC into another currency @hydraxon ?
mr.tinker 2:02 AM
i was going to say if you had it on the exchange you could shift it to another currency.

Should I set up a Jaxx agin until Polo fixes their shit?
mr.tinker 2:06 AM
Well if you do use Jaxx, use a higher payout. The problem is everyone setting their payouts to minimum which overloads the servers.

what platform are you using, @hgfh? @radix42 has ports of Zcash to Windows and OS X

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 8:46 AM
Bittrex only knew that there was a bug that affected Zclassic and ZenCash. However, since those coins share almost all of their code with Zcash, it wasn't entirely unreasonable for them to disable all Zcash-family coins at that point
They could have easily observed that the code in question was not in Zcash, without waiting for me to point that out. I'm not here to defend all of their actions; just explaining what their reasoning is likely to have been.

more specifically the bug was in code implementing a new OP_CHECKBLOCKATHEIGHT opcode, intended to prevent replays between ZenCash and Zclassic. This code is not needed in Zcash, at least not until we do a hard fork

    Statement from ZcashCo on Poloniex situation (July 2017)
    On 7 July, 2017 we became aware that the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex had disabled their Zcash wallet. We are not currently aware of any issue with the Zcash network. We monitor the Zcash network ourselves by running a few full nodes (out of the many full nodes currently running on the network). We are also constantly in communication with the Zcash community — the many markets and wallets , miners, developers, and users. We've reached out to Poloniex to ask if they are having an issue th...

Bittrex had their wallet offline also, did they give any reason?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:54 PM
I believe they saw the issue with the ZEN/ZCL bug and also took the ZEC wallets offline as a precaution. But I don't know for sure.
Even though the faulty code was never in Zcash, only those forks
daira July 10, 2017 2:38 AM
Their issue was that they disabled ZEC due to https://github.com/z-classic/zclassic/issues/97 , a potential bug in Zclassic and ZenCash code that is not actually present in Zcash (and would likely not have passed Zcash code review)

@mifeng: yes, you can [speak Chinese]. obviously many participants will only know English, but it's each person's decision what language they speak taking that into account
in general, what works quite well in technical contexts is to allow people to speak in a language they know, and then someone provides a translation for the benefit of other users. If the original speaker tries to machine-translate into English, that tends to work less well because mistakes in the translation are harder to correct; other users might not even know that it wasn't a native language of the speaker

Daira, beautifully put I couldn't say it better myself, for Zcash to be adopted & accepted, Language should not be restricted to English.

*in addition*, there are #zcash-es, #zcash-fr, #zcash-pt, #zcash-ru, and #zcash-zh channels for the benefit of Spanish, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese-language communities respectively, but that is not intended to restrict anyone from using languages other than English on other channels. In particular, if you want to ask a question about Zcash then, regardless of language, you're more likely to get a response on a topic-focused channel than a language-focused one

I highly doubt any coin will get where it was anytime soon, the events follow the 2013 mining frenzy, where the prices lured a lot of people into buying expensive equipment, shortly after the coins lost their value and never got close to their peak price.. I still have some hopes left tho 😉

Rocket.Chat/zizitop - hope is a good thing, but reality also matters. In the real world, a major stock, with major cash, assets and profits, Intel Corporation (INTC) is still selling at less than half it's dotcom bubble price - and that was more than 15 years ago. Also recall that Intel runs a real company, not a crack pipe dream with no cash and no profits like 90%+ of the other dotcoms.

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:26 AM
Bittrex was down briefly yesterday due to Zclassic and Zen issues, but Zcash was brought back after they found that Zcash was not affected by the bug in the Forks
But AFIK the only exchange not allowing ZEC deposit or withdraw is Poloniex.
And they have yet to provide an explanation why
The Zcash network is unaffected by the exchange issue and is functioning normally.
zizitop 7:29 AM
Hopefully all transactions show up when they reopen the wallets
fabio 7:30 AM
alright
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:31 AM
As long as they don't delete thier private keys to accounts, all funds should still be there when they re-sync to the Blockchain

@mineZcash How do miners, who where silly enough to mine to the Poloniex wallets, can get know their wallets secret keas? Poloniex won't disclose, as it fails even give reply to one's request (other than stanard text) bot formula.. At the end some deposit transactions sent by pool hanged somewhere, the rest kept by pool as an unpaid balance and may not be transfered to to functioning address without providing an original's secret kees...
Another question: is it possible to mine straight to the t-address generated through zcash4win client (I understand that this is a 3rd party app, but still, may be someone has an expierence?) Thanks

foodforthought 8:32 AM
@youguanxi
1. The keys are theirs – they belong to the hot wallet. You'd need to sell the ZEC for something else as long as ZEC withdrawals remain down.
2. This is certainly possible with zcash4mac, as it is simply a front-end for the zcashd process which is running (with a few modifications) in the background, as far as I understand. You just need the t-address to receive. To send/spend you need the private keys, which in this case are yours, and can be accessed via zcash4mac.

Yes, sorry all, the rocket chat was upgraded to the latest version which fixed a number of small bugs including the one where copy-to-clipboard only worked sporadically. But it also reset all avatars to default.
And on that same note, I just saw the rocket chat iOS team merged a fix for the Apple store rocket.chat app which was having trouble with different types of SSL certs. So once that is released it should be back to normal as well.

the first week of may is the slowest, there was an exchange sweeping dust-like amounts into a cold storage wallet with LOTS of inputs to each txn.....it will go slower while verifying those blocks once it gets there 😞
Does this mean Zcash is not a Zcash yet (I mean ZEC main unique market advantage)?

I'm still getting issues with sending ZEC from Z-addr to T-addr, despite a full re-index.
Have got an issue on GitHub and people are being very helpful.
But I imagine that not a lot of Z -sends are being done, and wanted to confirm from others here that they they are definitely functional with their wallets. Thanks
Maybe I just don't have enough Mem (4GB)??

Okay, ignore me.
This seems to be a known bug when you import wallets.
My problem duplicates https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2486

If they had had wallet corruption, I would certainly hope that they a) had backups, and b) would ask us about how to recover it
Actually best practice would be not to have too many users' keys in the same wallet, anyway (for both loss mitigation and performance reasons). That's not specific to Zcash

What are the chances that Polo is artificially suppressing the price of zcash to scare people off and accumulate ahead of Alphabay coming back online and Zcash shooting to 0.3? Or ... any speculation about what is happening with Alphabay at all? I don't really care about dark web but I think it has Zcash price implications.
foodforthought 9:17 AM
Thanks @kozyilmaz !!
Polo are currently saying "ZEC is currently under maintenance or experiencing wallet/network issues. Deposits and withdrawals will remain disabled until a solution is found, which may require an update from the ZEC team. Any updates must be tested and audited before enabling." on the trading page for ZEC.
Would be nice if they *did* contact the zcash team, by the sounds of things, rather than just being silent!

What's the problem with EWBF miner?
Fiagro 8:25 AM
I just started using EWBF Miner a few days ago. I have a 1080. I set MSI Afterburner to 75-80% power limit, it runs fine for a while... I check back like an hour later and my cards at 83'F and 100% power. I nudge the slider, hit apply, put it back, apply, and it behaves for a little bit.
So I guess it's more a MSI Afterburner issue, but it only started showing up since I began using EWBF
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:34 AM
@Fiagro you may have more luck speaking with other miners in the #zcash-mining channel
Fiagro 8:35 AM
Ah, okay. Thank you.
TakaiSaisei 8:35 AM
I think that the problem in MSI Afterburner/drivers. EWBF miner doesn't force P states or change clocks/power limit. And why did you lower the limit? I think it's really useless.
Fiagro 8:37 AM
Lowering power limit and increasing my memory clock actually increased my yield.
Also allows my card to run cooler.
TakaiSaisei 8:40 AM
Have you monitored the frequency of GPU and memory clock while lowering power limit? I'm not sure, but they must drop. Power limit != voltage.
Fiagro 8:41 AM
Yeah, with open hardware monitor
To my knowledge, setting a power limit to mine is a pretty standard thing
At stock settings it kept going up to 83' and throttling the core clock
full disclosure, I've only been doing this a month.
TakaiSaisei 8:48 AM
You really can't get low power limit with high frequency. It does not work like this. Especially, if you have throttling at stock settings. You will just get more throttling with OC, cause GPU will heat up faster and your TDP limit will be lower.
Fiagro 8:50 AM
The 1080 only throttles over 83'C
Mining is more dependent on memory clock than core clock. I'm familiar with the concepts you're describing, I was somewhat reluctant at first myself.
So I currently set mine at 80% power limit, +800MHz Memory Clock, stock core clock.
with 80% power limit, I never go above 72'C and I still have a 540 Sol/s yield.
Stock settings I hover around 83'C and get about 500 Sol/s
Gonna PM you a link, incase you're curious of the concepts.
TakaiSaisei 8:53 AM
Oh, I understood. Firstly I think that you have OCed core too.
Fiagro 8:53 AM
You're actually right. I had it at +150 and have been having this issue.
Today I put it back to 0
So do you think that theoretically the power was too low for the core clock and it possibly reverted to stock rather than crashing?
btw, thank you for taking the time and being patient. I'm kinda noob.
TakaiSaisei 9:04 AM
Not because of a possibly crashing, it must just run lower frequency. I think that it's a some sort of bug, power limit must be blocked despite high consumption. But I still think that lowering power limit is useless. You can just down GPU frequency if you want to run it cooler. Power limit will do it in the same way. But perhaps with some difference? idk
Sorry it took so long writing messages, English isn't my native language. Maybe because of this I was bad at delivering what I wanted to say.
Fiagro 9:07 AM
You're English is fine. I understand.
So try lowering my core clock?
TakaiSaisei 9:07 AM
Yes.
Fiagro 9:07 AM
Will do, Thank you again./

@zooko Hi, Zooko! It is an honor to get a reply from the founder. Let me be frank, I'm new to crypto world, have had no cryptoanarchist incentive, or connections to the cypher-punk community just a couple of month before & I'm far from being a geek or IT engineer, even less a mathematician. But I am here. Sure, there are some more people around. Came right on the crest of gold mining rush tsunami. With a hot head & lack of reason I have invested all my own + borrowed money & that’s why no way out of the submarine. Each next slope on the market (correction, Poloniex issue, segwit challenge, blockchain scalability in general, 50%+ network control threat caused by pool mining system, quantum computing ctypto challenge on the horizon etc.) now making me to dive deeper into ideas, people, market & become a bit of paranoic & a bit of brand advocate. From my philistine perspective, Zcash has a real potential to be among the winners. I like it’s straight & coherent concept, which actually seem to work. Because I do care, I want to express my concerns. I hope the team can judge not only from a protocol perspective, but also from trader’s viewpoint, can wear miner’s skin, and while not forgetting that potential customer should be a commoner & not a geek.
From trader’s viewpoint, there is a bitcoin – a market maker that has a value, because it is a real mean of payment, exchange & accumulation. Then there is Etherium, which already has gathered some high profile lobby around smart contracts, and there are other altcoins, that are only disposable wrapped ideas, each of which may be used once to make triple to 10 X by “shaking the weak money out” on the correction & hype noobs pain. From this point, the primary task of the team now should be not to slide from the 3rd place pursuit down to that shit-coin valley. Once out of top 10 – there will be no chances to climb up in; trader rather invest in another promising successor to make 10 X once again. Worth repeating, trader is the master – as long as there is no real-sector ZEC economy yet. On the contrary, holding the pursuit position will leave a space for maneuver & leap forward in the “Akela has missed” situation which may be approaching along with segwit or ever later on. Holding such a pursuit position, however, may require targeting the market broader than crypto-anarchist community and darknet (because I doubt that my personal example of enrolment is a sufficient way for the conquest of the market). Which in term, along with protocol reliability and security, implies scalability readiness, well-built multichannel public relations heartbeat, better usability, and corporate level customer service (provided directly or through incentive-driven partner hierarchy)? Everything that in the minds of the layman, confusing $300 mln coin capitalization with company’s market cap, would be expected from ZEC. Therefore, one need, as Russians call it, to crossbreed a hedgehog and a Rhino, hierarchy & decentralization, security & scalability. This might be a huge challenge; I really hope the team is running fast enough to stay in the place!
That’s why I’ve asked if Zcash has it’s regular marketing spokesperson?

@bitcartel This saying might derive from an old Soviet funny riddle, in which original players were a hedgehog & a Natrix snake (both sound similar in Russian уж - ёж, differ only in one letter), variants of saying been produced in effect: носорог и бегемот, eventually ёж и носорог etc. The riddle-joke: Q: What the effect of a hedgehog & a Natrix snake crossbreeding would be? A: 2m of razor wire. Nowadays, I guess, only a North Korea citizen would understand this joke.
bitcartel July 14, 2017 9:24 PM
Hi @youguanxi thanks for your post. Can you link to the Russian saying you mentioned - never heard it before and would like to know its origin! `Therefore, one need, as Russians call it, to crossbreed a hedgehog and a Rhino`

@KrasheR Most secure is hardware wallet: Trezor or Ledger. I have a ledger NanoS and wholeheartedly recommend it. If you don't want to pay for that, then run a full zcash node and use the built-in wallet on a machine you know is sensibly secure. Easiest with Linux, but there are versions for mac and windows. There are GUIs too (SwingWallet)

Don't use JAXX, it eventually crashes if you use it for mining

@youguanxi I'm assuming all transactions will eventually be sorted, they'll just need some time to get all their various wallets re-synced. I don't think you'll gain anything from sending multiple support tickets.

Yes, the next stage how to get rid of the "awaiting approval"? I have applied for the Poloniex Level 2 verification a week ago, hoping that would help, but with no effect: still unconfirmed & still awaiting approval, and not responsive
foodforthought 4:31 AM
@youguanxi Yeah I don't think Level will change anything – just your limits. They must have literally 10^5s support tickets, so l would just wait and see for a couple days.

KrasheR 5:26 AM
@foodforthought can you name me any good wallet for windows ? cuz i am currently using jaxx for mining
exodus is good?
foodforthought 5:28 AM
@KrasheR Personally I would recommend getting a hardware wallet - Ledger Nano S is good. All you need is chrome browser as software. I like it a lot, but it's a bit expensive and a waiting list.
KrasheR July 16, 2017 5:26 AM
@foodforthought can you name me any good wallet for windows ? cuz i am currently using jaxx for mining
Trezor I think also supports ZEC
Not sure about software wallets for windows. Others may be able to help. I know the windows port of the swing wallet is decent. But the keys are only as secure as your computer, so not ideal if you are worried about the security of your machine.
Definitely JAXX crashed on me, plus the JAXX website specifically states not to use for mining.
I use Mac and Linux, so not the best person to help. Can't comment on exodus.
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:38 AM
I personally prefer the full node wallets like the official Zcash client. It's not difficult to get used to the RPC Interface and you remain in control of your private keys.

looks cool
foodforthought 5:41 AM
Just double-check it supports ZEC. I'm 90% sure it does.
And windows, of course 😉
@mineZcash Yeah +1 this for Linux and Mac. Never tried the windows version, and personally inherently more worried about security on windows, but this is prob silly bias.

Because of performance issues with the Zcash client we are unable to send payout transactions to z addresses! Therefore DO NOT use z addresses to mine on the pool.

foodforthought 8:22 AM
@KrasheR Yeah all mining pools and cloud mining only support transparent addresses. All wallets (except full node) only support t-address transactions too. If you want to receive/send z-addr you'll need a full node, as per the link that @mineZcash has provided. Personally, I mine to a full node on Linux, then send to my Ledger Nano S for security. If I want to send shielded transactions, I use my Linux node. (I also have good experiences of zcash4mac as a full node).

Hey everyone. It's my first time in the chat, and I hope it's not the wrong place to ask, but I'm stuck on trying to transfer funds from my t-address, that I've been mining with. I've received about 0.187 zcash to my address from nanopool, which is verifiable through https://explorer.zcha.in , but zcash-cli reports 0 balance in my wallet through all possible commands to get balance and address info. "zcash-cli getreceivedbyaddress t1MqSmDq...." gives zero, "getbalance" gives zero, and a few other methods too. I get a "Could not find any non-coinbase UTXOs to spend" when trying to send zcash to another t-address, and "Insufficient funds, no UTXOs found for taddr from address." when I try to send (0.186 zec) to a z-address. Any help would be appreciated

The first time. Then after that, just a couple minutes each time you start up
petko10 9:11 AM
I was on about 107000 block height and the syncing was veery slow (1-10 blocks per minute) and I started a -reindex
which in retrospect might have been an error (now the sync is 10-15 blocks/s and there's ~150k .. thanks for the help!
petko10 9:22 AM
Is there some place to download the blockchain in bulk from and just validate it?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:30 AM
No, unfortunately there is not a way to do this in Zcash yet, when you're downloading the chain it's also checking the chain integrity.
It has been suggested though
petko10 9:36 AM
Would it be possible for a node owner to just get the blockchain file from another node owner and drop it in the .zcash directory ? If that's the case it all becomes a hosting problem, but if the daemon can not validate a transplanted blockchain I guess it's more complicated
foodforthought 10:00 AM
@petko10 Reindex means it starts again from the beginning, so you may have added some work for yourself 😉 @20Mbps, it took me c.4hours to download all c.150,000 blocks.
I believe it all slows down around May '17 (which may explain your slow-down ~107k), because Poloniex performed lots of transactions cleaning dust from a load of wallets (or something similar, that has been mentioned above by daira et al). You just have to be patient. Once it's downloaded, it only takes a few seconds to update if you run it each day.
petko10 July 16, 2017 9:13 AM
which in retrospect might have been an error (now the sync is 10-15 blocks/s and there's ~150k .. thanks for the help!
It goes without saying, I guess, but I'll say it anyway. To see your funds, you need to be up to date with at least the block in which they were confirmed. To send them, it's safest to wait til the whole thing is synced.

yes, sure, but still, there should be a plan, I wonder why nobody ask himself this question, if crypto-currency has such a tremendous processing cost and scalability issues. Miners do support the network as long as it's profitable. Cost of equipment is high & Moore’s law will come to an end after EUV-lithography within 10 year perspective, & at the same time within this timeframe a quantum qubit-power might be available for corporate & government sector, which poses additional pressure for crypto-hash power requirements in order to keep privacy & security. Take into account green-energy policy bias, which means higher electricity costs. When emission is over, even if we talking about 25 year horizon - there still should be an expressed vision of the development scenarios. As a possible variant, switching to transaction fee distribution among miners model along with limiting the minimum transaction amount - so the block chain would become useful for b2b or real-estate market only? To have a reference points, assuming it aleatoric, is not a crime, but a way to avoid a hard fork in the future & a must for a serious startup. Nobody believe ZEC can stand that long?

tromer Zcash Foundation 11:27 AM
@youguanxi Yes, post-emission mining incentive is a very important, and difficult, question. The default answer for Zcash, as for Bitcoin and many others, is "transaction fees".
It's indeed unclear how well this is work in in the real market. We're studying how this plays out for other cryptocurrencies. In the decades it will take for this to become an urgent matter for Zcash, we will know much more about what changes, if any, are needed in Zcash.
Yes, implementing changes may require a hard fork, but Zcash's philosophy is that hard forks are an acceptable and expected way to make progress --- when the technical implementation is done right, and with proper community support and discussion.
A healthy, open, constructive community discussion is crucial here. So I really appreciate your participation and the excellent points you raised here and earlier.
foodforthought 12:17 PM
it's easier to have a hard fork when there is an over-arching company/authority/organisation.
Hopefully zcash wont have the same issues as bitcoin is currently having.

@anarch3 true, but still with a GPU-mining there is, at least theoretically, a place for people, an opportunity to collectively prevent the situation when someone gets a majority. Zhou not forgeting, there is a Pool mining vulnerability & an ASIC inevitable perspective. BTW, I think disadvantage of the proof-of-stake - that network could be manipulated by the "hot"\rapid speculative capital coming & leaving within minutes or even seconds, to build and tune an enterprise scale farm is totally different story.

I am running an older node version on Ubuntu. Can someone please point me to directions to update my zcash client ?
im running version 1000851
seion 5:20 PM
Having some issues with zcash mining
I am using windows 10 with a 650 PSU / 1200 HP Green PSU
Moved it to an open air rig with powered risers, using the 650 to power the risers , using the 1200 to power the GPU's
Currently have a 1080 mini, 1080 amp, 960 gtx
When I had this inside a case with just the 1080 mini / 960 on just one PSU I was getting good hash rates 560 OC for 1080 and around 190 with the 960, no risers
When I moved it to the open air, risers and one PSU hashrate dropped on the 1080 mini
Added the 1200 psu and the other 1080 and still crap hashrate... any ideas
X0R3 5:21 PM
Seion, the risers are often the issue. Try to switch them out.
seion 5:22 PM
😞
ill give that a test
X0R3 5:23 PM
I keep spare risers around for this reason
I have a farm and I can tell you that I have replaced 10+ risers that were bad.
seion 5:25 PM
ill swap them out but they are from the same batch i ordered, I ordered 6 and using 3
X0R3 5:26 PM
swap the risers out and see
seion 5:27 PM
if thats not it, suggestions? It feels like when I open up msi afterburner (without changing anything) hash drops a bunch
X0R3 5:28 PM
first switch the risers on the gpus that are not working , check all connections (power, usb,)
seion 5:28 PM
the other 1080 I plugged in is only getting 60 sol/s only pulling 73watts...
should be getting at least 500sols/s

@radix42 About memory bandwidth, reminds me of https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/wheres-the-beef-why-fpgas-are-so-fast/. They explicitly note FPGAs are so fast due to the large memory bandwidth available and explicit control and what to do with the cycles. I noticed clouds are starting to offer FPGAs as a service too (AWS advertisement I just saw, for instance).

    www.microsoft.com
    Where’s the Beef? Why FPGAs Are So Fast - Microsoft Research
    Where do all the cycles go when microprocessor applications are implemented spatially as circuits on an FPGA? It is well established that certain sequential applications can be captured spatially and achieve breathtaking speedups when run on an FPGA, but why? Despite running at clock speeds orders of magnitude slower compared to their embedded processor equivalents, …

@radix42 Have you contacted Nallatech et al by the way? They used to offer free OpenCL-FPGA cards to people if they wanted to make a public project with them. The cards used to be worth something like 5000 € a piece. 🙂
Wink, wink. 😉 I don't know if they have such offers anymore. I asked them about the prices a few years ago and concluded with their sales representative I can't justify such a cost as I was thinking more in the GPU range. 🙂

Hi everybody
any idea which best price got zcash tonight?
youguanxi 3:18 PM
Someone, please explain me one thing about tx fee, it might be simple, but I just didn't completely understand tx fee nature:) It is a miner who do transaction processing, right? The fee declared by the sender, who runs a full node, should directly correspond to the miner reward, isn't it? That is to say total tx fee amount should be exactly equal to the amount of ZEC coin emission (like a conventional bank credit multiplier)? But in this case emission-inflation would definitely be infinite & can't be limited to 21mln. Who is my fee addressee, then? I find it fair to offer the fee to other nodes in the network, which will do the job of confirming & storing my transaction. But in this case benefits should be on reciprocal basis, i.e. when my node handles someone's transaction it should receive a fee aswell. I run a full node 24\7 with Zcash4win GUI, & I have not ever mentioned receiving any fee. I still can't figure out what is it all about?
jasondavies 3:47 PM
@youguanxi only miners get rewarded (they get both the transaction fees and the block reward for any block that they mine)
foodforthought 3:54 PM
@brandon Yeah, don't let anyone try and sell you a zcash ASIC – it will be a scam.
brandon July 20, 2017 10:11 AM
do we expect to see zcash asics soon?
@youguanxi You can simply set 'gen=1' to activate CPU mining, and you'll eventually get a mining reward.
https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/1.0-User-Guide#enabling-cpu-mining
But it's not a very efficient way of doing it, and you'll probably end up spending more on electricity than you make in ZEC.
You really need multiple dedicated GPUs and some of the optimised GPU mining code that's available, plus connection to a pool to smooth your returns (plus cheap electricity).

youguanxi 4:03 PM
No, my question was about tx fee adressee & tx fee - miner reward - ZEC emission connection. So when I do a GPU mining my reward is measured with a hashrate, which corresponds to block mining & not to tx fees, is this wrong?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:05 PM
Yes, the pool you are mining to calculates your reward based on your hashrate
The pool operator gets to keep the tx fees that were included in that block, and pays workers based on hashpower
If you were lucky enough to find a Block Solo you would get both the ZEC+fees
youguanxi 4:09 PM
Aha, then there, indeed, is a direct connection between tx fee & miner reward, which do mean that total ZEC emission is equal to the total ammount of tx fees?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:13 PM
The total coin emission remains the same, the tx fees are subtracted from other wallets, not created from thin air.
The total amount ever will always be 21 Million
youguanxi 4:24 PM
As far as I know, each pool independently chooses & declares which amount it will substract from miners rewards, for example, flypool takes 1%. On the other hand, the amount of tx fee may be also randomly choosen by a ZEC user sender prior to transaction. So pool will collect both - the tx fee from the sender + 1% from the miner reward?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:28 PM
Yes, that's about the size of it. Unless the pool pays out 100% of the block reward to the miners.
You will notice that most calculators like whattomine.com don't account for the tx fees in a block, only the block reward.
Yet, most pools payout is pretty close to that calculators estimate.
(It's also near impossible to calculate accurately because it depends on the # of tx included in a block)
youguanxi 4:33 PM
The only role of the tx fee, I can name so far, is transaction speed regulation, correct?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:35 PM
Pretty much, that why some people were paying absurd gas fees to use ETH during some of the ICOs, to have thier bid included before others

    What is ‘right?’ Why do we need to pay? And other tantalizing questions answered

youguanxi 4:41 PM
Now I understand, thank you for a likbez:) I was a bit confused, on waiting my transaction to be processed for more than an hour & than 2,5 hours more for the reqiured confirmations. This is because, I've set up 0 fee 🙂
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:41 PM
And it also helps guard against DoS by making such an attack too expensive
youguanxi 4:41 PM
wise
youguanxi 4:48 PM
And what does formula "you are mining at 1% fee & you are not donating" mean? Has the tx fee anything to do with either donation, or fee here?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:51 PM
1% is the cut the operator is subtracting from your individual reward, you can choose to donate more than that 1% if you want.
The rich miners donate 100% 😅
Jk
youguanxi 4:59 PM
🙂
youguanxi 5:05 PM
" If you’ve received many small payments to your wallet (such as receiving a daily payout from your cloud mining of 0.003 BTC), and you want to spend a large amount, these small payments need to be combined into one transaction (to send 0.5 BTC, for example, you’d need to spend 166 payouts of 0.003 BTC). A signature must be provided for each payout spent, which severely bloats the transaction size, increasing the fee associated with it" - is it the same with ZEC? Probably this is why my instance of zcashd have kept loading my 16-thread Xeon E5-2650 to 100% busy for around an hour combining 16 small payments on my private Z-wallet prior to sending the whole amount in one transaction? Is there a different mechanics, which applies?
youguanxi 5:22 PM
BTW, here I see a vulnarability! if a pool, as long as it collects & usurp tx fees, posess a considerable share of total network hashpower it may well manipulate current minimum tx fee level, sufficient for a transaction to be processed relatively fast , simply by keep on passing big quantities of "stress-test" transactions back and forth between certain wallets. Last night Flypool, for exmple, momentarily had 115 Mh while the whole network disposed less than 200! Any comments?

" If you’ve received many small payments to your wallet (such as receiving a daily payout from your cloud mining of 0.003 BTC), and you want to spend a large amount, these small payments need to be combined into one transaction (to send 0.5 BTC, for example, you’d need to spend 166 payouts of 0.003 BTC). A signature must be provided for each payout spent, which severely bloats the transaction size, increasing the fee associated with it" - is it the same with ZEC? Probably this is why my instance of zcashd have kept loading my 16-thread Xeon E5-2650 to 100% busy for around an hour combining 16 small payments on my private Z-wallet prior to sending the whole amount in one transaction? Is there a different mechanics, which applies?
however, the potential DoS attack here doesn't really depend on having a large proportion of hash power, that just *may* provide more of an incentive to do it. We have plans to mitigate DoS, both short-term and long-term

You can also send from a z-addr to a z-addr and from a t-addr to a t-addr 😉
In the cases where a z-addr is the origin, the source address will be hidden on the blockchain.

So, newb dreamer question. Shielded TXs aren't malleable? So ... can Zcash do a kind of lightning network without segwit?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:35 AM
The transparent parts of shielded transactions are malleable in the same ways as in Bitcoin. JoinSplit descriptions are not malleable, so fully shielded transactions are also not malleable
(By "fully shielded" I'm also excluding doing anything exotic with the transaction fee.)
As far as I understand, Lightning network can be done on Bitcoin without segwit; it's just a matter of efficiency, not possibility
Our preferred off-chain transaction protocol is BOLT, which apparently does not require nonmalleability (I haven't looked at why in detail)

Nittro 5:37 AM
hi, Now I'm using a zcash4win wallet, would you like to know how I'll get access to the amount deposited in my old wallet?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:38 AM
Did you create that address with your zcash4win wallet?
Nittro 5:38 AM
yes
my old wallet
im create in linux
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:38 AM
Are you sure that wallet is fully synced?
Nittro 5:38 AM
but now i'm use win10
my new wallet i think so yes
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:39 AM
So you have two wallets?
nolimit 5:40 AM
@mineZcash Android app and Apple app so people can shop with zcash
Nittro 5:41 AM
now i stop mine with nanopool because my payout do automatic and i dont know what to do about it
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:42 AM
Yes, that would be awesome @nolimit , the first step is to get vendors that sell things to accept Zcash, then Apps will support them.
You have to change the payout Address in your miner configuration to choose a new payout Address @Nittro
Do you still have access to your old wallet?
Nittro 5:44 AM
@mineZcash , yes i have t1J4hAnJaBzxMNDkFe3LP8vStT2USV2Cxqb
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:46 AM
So you can send the ZEC from the Linux wallet to the new wallet in Windows
Just make a new address in Windows to send to
Then you can also use that address to get your pool payout
Nittro 5:49 AM
@mineZcash , with my z-address right?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:50 AM
Pools only payout to t-addresses for now, so you will need to make another t-address like your old one
Nittro 5:51 AM
@mineZcash , ok now i undestood thank you for your attention.

tromer Zcash Foundation 10:48 AM
@valkenburgh, great work on the above!
(Link to the full model regulation: http://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/regulation of virtual currencies/2017AM_URVCBA_AsApproved.pdf)
I have a question about the interpretation of "exchange", as it applies to essentially-non-custodial virtual currency exchange services, such as ShapeShift. virtual currency exchange system. To simplify, this work as follows: an exchange rate is agreed upon, a user sends funds to the service, and as soon as those the transfer is confirmed (typically minutes), the service transfers the corresponding funds in the other currency.
Does this falls under 102(5) as "exchange", because the service assumes 102(3)(a) "control" of the user's funds for those few minutes?
If so, would XCAT avoid that? Recall that the XCAT (Cross-Chain Atomic Trades) mechanism allows secure trading of virtual currencies, such that neither party can abscond with the funds: the trade is technically guaranteed to be either fully settled or fully reverted within a prescribed timeframe. However, one of the parties -- in this scenario, probably the exchange service -- gets the final technical control over whether the trade is completed or reverted. (Essentially, they can just walk away at the last stage of the protocol, and then the trade is reverted.)
So: does a ShapeShift-like service that uses XCAT fall under 102(5) as "exchange", and in particular is considered to "assume "control" of user funds under 102(3)(a)? Intuitively, there's no unilateral "control" of the funds because the service cannot abscond with the funds. But one can also argue that there is "control" under 102(3)(a), since the service prevent can "prevent indefinitely a virtual currency transaction": XCAT ensures that *one* of those two transactions (settle or revert) will happen; but the *choice* between them is still unilaterally controlled.
This seems like an important question, because to the extent that XCAT already protects users from rogue exchanges, there is no need for burdensome redundant regulations to ensure the same.
valkenburgh Zcash Foundation 10:50 AM
Hey @tromer Shapeshift's service would likely fit the definition of exchange because of momentary control over the digital currency being swapped.
the goal of the definition of control, and a definition of exchange that requires control, however, was intentionally designed to limit the law's applicability and exempt XCAT as well as sidechain pegs.
if one or the other (settle or revert) must happen, then I think there is a good argument that the service provider does not have the unilateral ability to prevent transactions indefinitely
one would argue (I think intuitively) that the "transaction" is the whole set of alternatives. The transaction is I either (a) get the token I wanted in the exchange or (b) get my original token back. The service provider may create a technical arrangement that will allow you to engage in that transaction but they can not unilaterally execute that transaction or indefinitely prevent you from executing that transaction

@foodforthought I believe it had to do with the way Poloniex handles their very large amount of transactions, somehow caused a wallet issue. Which is interesting since Poloniex is the second largest ZEC exchange by volume, yet HitBTC who is larger and Bittrex who also has lots of transactions daily haven't reported any issues.

    We've confirmed with Poloniex that the suspension of Zcash deposits and withdrawals from approximately from July 7th through July 15th was due to a wallet corruption and performance problems in the wallet implemented by the zcashd (MagicBean) software, under conditions of Poloniex's large-scale and increasing usage. The issue did not threaten security of Poloniex user funds because Poloniex had backed-up the wallet. To make sure your funds are safe, see Wallet Backup Instructions. The Poloni...

Regarding news with a SEC and a BTC-e tags. it is worthwhile considering to move Zerocoin Electric Coin Company equity, IP & data to another juristdiction... I think this is just the beginning of the campaign. There aren't much options available, thou:) I can name North Korea as long as comrade Kim uses enterprise scale crypto mining to bypass US sanctions and cover state's import needs. Another candidate of great symbolic importance as a crypto-anarchist capitol free of gov. regulation is Antarctic (afaik, as of now only Russia has it's floating mobile nuclear power grid in production, designed specifically for Arctic region, need to lease one to feed crypto-heating boilers for the new capitol)! Or go ahead, deploy the headquarter on the ship sailing neutral ocean waters, as Ron Hubbard, allegedly, did. The last, but not the least, one could consider some non-recognised by the West client states of Russia like Novorossya (Donbass) & South Osetia - the chance here is an opportunity of introducing a revolutionary crypto-anarchist plan for an entire society being under siege, with distributed ledgers implemented throughout the public sector starting from law enforcement, procecusion, elections, land, equity & identity registers, state order supply chains, to finance, cooperative banking & so on & so forth:) These are only beyond FATCA & CIA true offshores by now. This could be a hurdle for ZCash mass adoption, but taking in account it's scalability limits...worth consideration. From such a platform one can promote Zcash as a hedge for Bitcoin in the face of regulation challenge, similar as Litecoin is the hedge for Bitcoin in the face of fork. What does community think? Is regulation for good & Zcash selective disclosure feature should be opened to tax authorities by default as, for example, all messangers providing their customer private keys to NSA? 😉

@misiak I have had expressed similar considerations on a spokesperson earlier. What does Dash have more - is scalability, mobile apps & wallets straight from the dev team to stimulate mass adoption, which is not even on Zcash team radar, afaik. Who cares that smartphone equals insecurity? Due to different token distribution model, Dash has broader coinbase, i.e. market cap now - this is also a signal for a trader. At the same time, they might have more funds in the treasury available for devs & marketing. Since JP Morgan interest in zkSNARKS, there were no major positive triggers for zCash.

crypto.world 4:39 AM
Any cold storage wallets yet that supports "Z-Addresses "?? Trezor & Nano Ledger only have "T-Addresses", for a private, anonymous coin
Any work being done to implement Z-addresses?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:42 AM
@crypto.world depends
"Cold storage wallets" could mean several things.
You can easily generate a z-addr on an offline computer and send funds to it

    👍 1 

To spend *from* that address though you currently need to bring the address online, or do some more advanced manual syncing of the blockchain data from an online node to the offline one
It's possible though to make this easier, and I opened https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2542 to do so 🙂

    github.com
    Add RPC methods for creating shielded transactions offline · Issue #2542 · zcash/zcash
    With t-addrs, it is possible to run a "split-node" configuration, where the user runs two nodes: a watching node, which downloads the block chain and tracks balances via watch addresses. an offlin...

If you instead mean hardware wallets (which is likely what you mean given you mention Trezor & Nano Ledger), the current limitation is that hardware wallets don't have the power to make shielded transactions (and likely won't ever).
To enable hardware wallets to store shielded funds, we need what is called "payment offloading", where the computations are executed on a machine that you trust with your privacy (they can see where you are sending the funds) but not security (they can't authorize the spend themselves).
That is one of the features we are looking into adding with the Sapling network upgrade 🙂
In the hardware wallet case, the "trusted machine" is your own personal computer, so there's no actual privacy loss.
youguanxi 4:48 AM
@str4d But this is still a crutch
str4d July 31, 2017 4:46 AM

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:49 AM
@youguanxi not really. Hardware wallets already require a crutch
Hardware wallets only do signing; all the transaction creation, network communication etc. happens in an app on your computer
So payment offloading just extends that model to z-addrs
If you instead want to go *further* than that, and have your local computer itself not be privy to the transaction details, you need to have an actual offline computer (since you'd need to be able to input transaction details, addresses etc. on the "hardware device"), at which point it will likely have enough power to create the proofs too
So that reduces to the standard split of watching-wallet vs. offline-wallet
and even that has limits, because the watching wallet needs to be able to identify incoming transactions to be transferred to the offline wallet, so at the very least it can detect both incoming and outgoing (sent via it) transactions
youguanxi 5:12 AM
@str4d Thanks for your clarification! Maybe it would have a practicle sense, to offer to an end customer a p&p bootable image of the OS (Linux, for instance) includining a Zcash full-node GUI and a dedicated locked security & firewall settings (with an option of a TOR node) optimised for x86 architecture (for Intel compustick devices), as well as ARM processors (for Raspberry Pi 3 depoyment? Thus people can get hard-wallets affordable, mobile, yet powerfull enough for processing z-address transactions?
str4d July 31, 2017 4:49 AM
@youguanxi not really. Hardware wallets already require a crutch
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:15 AM
It's certainly a possibility, and should be feasible after Sapling (which aims to reduce the computational power required to make shielded transactions). It could probably be done using a variant of Tails or Whonix
(More likely Whonix, which already has the separation concept of a Gateway vs Workstation, and could probably be hacked to support connecting the two securely via USB)
(That would require running the Gateway as a VM on the computer, but that could probably be packaged with enough engineering work)
crypto.world 5:17 AM
Yes I was referring to cold storage wallets such as Trezor, that's the sole purpose I have Trezor so I don't have to use computer - online wallets as sending/receiving crypto online is riskier than storing it directly into Trezor. I was hoping Zcash would have partnered with other Wallet sources by now to add the Z-address as that's the whole purpose of many Zcash holders- privacy & anonymity of shielding our transactions, & for the non-Developer creating the address as you described above would be a challenge to most.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:36 AM
Yeah, at this time you can only store funds in a t-addr on a hardware wallet. One thing we're currently working on is payment offloading for spending from t-addrs to z-addrs, which will enable hardware wallet users to pay anybody. And of course anyone can pay to their t-addrs already. For z-addrs on hardware wallets though, we'll have to wait at least until after Sapling is deployed.

@str4d When I first encountered Bitcoin & Zcash economy, I was wondering what a tx fee is all about? OK, it is required for tx processing priority adjustment & as an anti-attack filter, but why does a pool, not an end miner benefit from it? Finally, won’t it be logical to reward those who run full nodes with tx fees instead, as long as, actually, a storage of significant amounts of up to date blockchain data 24\7 is required, which is currently provided by early adopters on a volunteer basis? Trend toward hardware & light wallets is evident because running a full node is burdensome & waiting until block chain synchronized seems ridiculous for a common user. One can argue that a key-storage device will not ever be capable to deliver a sufficient power to process Zcash shielded tx, but I believe should there be a demand the supply follow. The more that, Sapling will be lightweight enough to run a Z-shielding math on a smartphone or a tablet based light-client. Why not separate decentralized full-node database from common Zcash users and provide incentive to run a full node instance by tx fees, thus merging a miner rig & a full-node? Mining rigs could stop waste its hard-drive resources & serve as blockchain gateways for third party users aswell. With light client on a smartphone or dedicated hard wallet usability would move Zcash "order of magnitude" closer to mass adoption. As a by-product, unfair practice of usurping tx fees by pools may be terminated. In this regard, is there a fair reason to stick to BTC-core? Hope the team is monitoring the Dash Evolution & other competitor’s progress.
str4d July 31, 2017 5:15 AM
It's certainly a possibility, and should be feasible after Sapling (which aims to reduce the computational power required to make shielded transactions). It could probably be done using a variant of Tails or Whonix

what is the advantage of using Full Node + Wallet ?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:07 PM
A full node and wallet will support the network by verifing transactions and you will be able to use Zcash private addresses. The lite wallets don't support private transactions yet.

foodforthought 10:39 AM
Oh right, wait. Are you hoping to get stuff in your wallet by mining? Or have you sent ZEC to your wallet?
You're mining with the default solver on a single thread. You're gonna be waiting a long, long time.
I assumed you were waiting for a recent transaction, when we spoke before.
You're solving at 2.7x10^-10 % (0.000000000267644%) of the network rate.
At this rate, it will take you (on average) 1811 years to mine 1 ZEC.

    Mining rig minimum price beginner
    Yes IT will handle it Easy, even have power to add one more later on, That all looks 100% correct Happy to help

If you want to mine ZEC:
1. You need a GPU rig to stand any chance of getting a coin. See the forum I have linked to above for examples.
2. You can smooth your returns (minus a small fee) by mining to a pool, so that you get regular returns, rather than waiting to get "lucky" on a block. Returns from an individual miner are stochastic, with probability of success a function of H/s

[OFTC/Siecje] @rocket.cat Bot 8:00 AM

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:04 AM
They aren't
If you use z-addresses
There is a transaction on the block chain, but the information in it is encrypted
If you use t-addresses, those transactions are just as transparent as Bitcoin

[OFTC/Siecje] @rocket.cat Bot 8:25 AM
I'm assuming you need to specify all ancestors in the blockchain that are encrypted and how to decrypt them? But then it is not anonymous since all miners will be able to look at them.
[OFTC/Siecje] @rocket.cat Bot 8:25 AM
It seems like you can't have a public leger and anonymous transactions
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:40 AM
Siecje, that's where the magic comes in 😉
Specifically, we use what are called "zero-knowledge proofs", so that miners can validate transactions without knowing what is inside them
So it's a publicly-run ledger, and all transactions on it satisfy the consensus rules, but some of those consensus rules are validated on data that is private on the ledger

str4d Were you in the ceremony or is that the royal we? Right but what happend to the zcash currency that was created during the first ceremony?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:47 AM
The ceremony wasn't to create currency - that is created via mining as usual
It was to create the circuit, which is required for the zero-knowledge proofs
I wasn't a part of the ceremony myself, so yes royal we
And the circuit from the first ceremony is being used today! It's what the network has been using since the launch of Zcash
When the Sapling upgrade is released with the new circuit from the next ceremony, there will be a way to migrate ZEC from the old circuit to the new one 🙂

You would need to fork / mod the script for folks to mine to their own ZEC address though !

Hi Brandon
brandonb 8:11 AM
Hey
I had a question in regards to mining
Right now I am using cards with 4GB or more of RAM, Zcash doesn't need that. I want to mine Zcash, what is the size of the DAG?
I am thinking about building a new rig specifically for zec

@DeZZZ the address above is in your Jaxx wallet but it says 0 balance? You should bring this up to Jaxx support. But if you want to import the address into a different wallet, that's also possible.
You should be able to import an address into any wallet. Do you prefer sticking to mobile or would a desktop wallet suffice?

@Emil Hi, AFAIK there is no ASIC for Equhash available yet due to n&k params in the algo. However, if Zcash exchange rate will grow steadily, this is a matter of time. Btw, you'd better forward your question to #zcash-mining channel
Emil August 11, 2017 6:49 AM
Good day
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:51 AM
It's not a matter of time; we'll very likely change the parameters if ASICs start to look feasible
ASIC developers should bear in mind that there's a high risk of them losing their development costs
youguanxi 8:09 AM
@daira Daira, do you think that 7,5Mhs rig hopping in the flypool for about 20minutes consists of some 20k GPU's or isn't it more likely to be some 500 ASIC's?

Hello there! I am having some trouble finding ZCash Roadmap nad the Whitepaper on the main website. Could you please link them to me?

Thanks you very much.
jasondavies 2:19 PM
Roadmap: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/wiki/Roadmap

    github.com
    zcash/zcash
    zcash

@Donuts23 I'm not sure what would count as a "whitepaper"; the protocol is documented very precisely here but it's fairly technical: https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf

    github.com
    zcash/zips
    zips - Zcash Improvement Proposals

See also for more verbose explanations of the technology: https://z.cash/technology/

    z.cash
    Zcash - Technology

Donuts23 2:26 PM
Yes, that would be the Whitepaper.
Thank you very much! I would suggest putting these 2 things very visible and easy to find on the first page of the main website. It will make people have more credibility in the cause. But I do like what ZCash is doing so far, very organized and hard working people on it. Plus a fast response on live chat is crucial! Thanks again!
jasondavies 2:27 PM
You're welcome, and thanks for the suggestion, I'll pass it on
Donuts23 2:29 PM
Most coin websites use this model which I find very clean and professional: https://dentacoin.com/

You can find a brief explanation of what they are doing on the first paragraph, and right beneath it, an option to download the Whitepaper in several languages.

Also if you scroll down or click on the "When" tab, you will see the roadmap separated in blocks and dates.

I hope it is helpful!

    dentacoin.com
    Dentacoin

jasondavies 2:37 PM
@Donuts23 I take your point about the roadmap, I agree it would be nice to make that more prominent somehow. I think the protocol PDF I linked to is potentially too technical to be prominently linked (it *is* actually linked to from the footer). Note that what Zcash actually does *is* described on the home page, under "what is zcash?" though it's quite concise.
Donuts23 2:44 PM
Most whitpaper are more detailed and also some a bit more technical. I don't know if what you sent me is considered an actual Whitepaper. I do agree that it is very technical in some segments. But anyways, just my opinion as a Crypto Investor :)

Cheers! Keep up the good work!
tromer Zcash Foundation 2:45 PM
The Zerocash academic paper is a more gentle (though a bit outdated) technical introduction.
It does not cover the "coin" aspects of interest to typical investors.
But how about the "Tech" link?
jasondavies 2:59 PM
The "tech" link is also linked to via the large "learn more" link on the home page. I think maybe the protocol specification could be bumped up in prominence to appear near the published Zerocash paper on the "tech" page. I opened a ticket on GitHub so no-one forgets.

I may be biased because I wrote most of the Zcash protocol spec, but I have to say most coin whitepapers fall between two stools: they're too technical for most users, and not detailed or precise enough for implementors or protocol security analysts

The Zcash protocol spec is firmly aimed at the latter group. For user-oriented explanations, see our blog posts
youguanxi 2:05 AM
Hi, everybody! Can someone, please, explain me a shielding transaction on the case of coin base shielding? A miner, in order to avoid public disclosure of the farm total hash rate, setts up individual t-addresses for each of his mining rigs. My question is: if one to transfer funds from multiple t-addresses to a certain Z-address, would the link between those t-addresses be publicly exposed & traceable in a block-chain explorer through a common destination address, or would destination Z-address conceal all the tails?
jasondavies 2:10 AM
@youguanxi As long as the transfer occurrs as one transaction per source t-addr, it should be impossible to link them
youguanxi 2:15 AM
Thanks, Jason! Just want to be sure:) Thus, the only way to track down a miner is by sorting out traffic to\from a pool, right?
jasondavies 2:18 AM
If your farm is sending shares from a single IP address (or multiple addresses that are somehow linked), then you may be disclosing your total hash rate to the pool that way, yes
jasondavies 2:24 AM
Out of interest, is there a reason to avoid public disclosure of hash rate if it's only linked to a random t-addr (alternatively you could receive payouts to a z-addr if the pool supports it)? I've seen some high numbers on Fly pool and often wondered why the owners do not simply solo mine if their hash rate is that high.
youguanxi 2:26 AM
Pools often do not offer mining to Z-addresses. The reason could be a personal security, particularly actual under certain jurisdictions:)

@tromer Pardon, you've got me wrong, personal security was mentioned in regard with t-address, not Z-address. This threat is quite obvious, starting from sniffing burglars, down to corrupt police. Some folks have seen their enterprise scale farm confiscated under the court sentence in Ukraine just couple of days ago. This may well be the precedent, not necessarily turning into a legal practice, but definitely a motive for racket by law enforcement officers

My testnet node can't do outgoing SOCKS connections, because it runs in 'non-anonymous' mode i.e. HiddenServiceStatistics 0 HiddenServiceSingleHopMode 1 HiddenServiceNonAnonymousMode 1 - however, if the other node exists (and can make outgoing SOCKS connections) please could the operator ' ./src/zcash-cli addnode tazy4us2qli2sd7e.onion add ' as I would like to start testing a few things! https://atlas.torproject.org/#details/8D610CFD4FD193034381199106C8EA3E10433A64 - Cheers!

@tromer Pardon, you've got me wrong, personal security was mentioned in regard with t-address, not Z-address. This threat is quite obvious, starting from sniffing burglars, down to corrupt police. Some folks have seen their enterprise scale farm confiscated under the court sentence in Ukraine just couple of days ago. This may well be the precedent, not necessarily turning into a legal practice, but definitely a motive for racket by law enforcement officers

The projects nodes are ... "helping to strengthen the network and contributing to a social good", both the Tor network and Zcash. Building Tor directly into Zcash likely presents some other issues ... https://www.torproject.org/docs/trademark-faq.html - there is no 'one size fits all' solution to this, I agree however that users should have a choice over what (anonymity) network they want to use. This should also be made as easy as possible for the majority of users. I assume most folks here are certainly on the same page in this regard.

@rocket.cat I don't think I missed your earlier point(s) in this regard. Forcing the majority of Zcash nodes to run over Tor automatically via ephemeral addnode=.onion hidden_services may seem like a great idea, but its really not that great for either networks or for every use case (even with an opt-out). Other crypto-currency projects that have actually already done this have not faired so well i.e. Stealthcoin, various "Torcoin's" etc.,

One should not simply apply their own preferred use case for privacy over the needs, requirements or preferences of other individuals, organisations or businesses, imo. Network diversity actually facilitates increased privacy for those that require it and individual choice with as few possible restrictions and without hindrances is key.

Now lets imagine that Zcash scales to Bitcoin levels in terms of user base. This would present a real P2P burden for the existing Tor network and for its volunteer server operators, without giving any bandwidth back to the Tor network, if the majority of Zcash nodes were only ephemeral .onion nodes, as Client Only (for best case anonymity). Now, lets assume that you give all Zcash node (wallet) users the opportunity to switch on Relaying or Exiting Tor traffic - most users likely won't enable this option and anyone that does would quickly discover complaints from their ISP or find that because their network is operating as a Tor exit node that they are suddenly unable access their favorite website (when not using Tor!) because they have been operating a Relay or Exit node (and have had their IP added to a blocklist) : https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/org/doc/ListOfServicesBlockingTor - I have personal experience of this, as I once ran a Relay and Exit node from my home 'static' IP address in the UK!

xyZcash 3:06 PM
Whilst I'm certainly not as talented a coder or developer as @str4d I have been using Tor and operating Relays, Exit Nodes and Bridges for more than 8 years now! So, I to know a fair amount with regards to Tor. This is me too : https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5.msg188#msg188 - so, if you consider fortune/wealth a mark of success, then thus far I've been mostly 'unlucky' in crypto (not all of my own making though). Lastly, I don't consider my requests for community support or my proposal to be 'worthless'. The incoming addnode=.onion connections from Zcash users strongly suggests otherwise and last month the project nodes served well over 20 TeraBytes of Tor traffic. A plethora of Tor ISP's and node operators already seek donations for their node provision, so this is no different to that. Believe you me, if I still had pots of BTC the Tor network would have a lot more nodes than it does today and I would continue to go out of my way to help as many open source projects as I possibly could.

The Blog is currently the best place to find official information.

Paige makes a good summary of what happens each week. Development is a slow process, so there isn't a big fancy press release that will accompany every small improvement.

Sounds like there is an unmet need for "all of the Zcash news in one RSS feed", for people who want more frequent, more detailed, (and therefore inevitably less-carefully-vetted) news than the weekly dev updates offer.

    Hi Austin, I'm largely responsible for the fact that ZcashCo has not initiated a wallet development effort. Why? There are several reasons: First and most fundamental, opportunity costs: We've been busy at work on a few key things: first, a new protocol (codenamed Sapling) which will have incredible benefits, including for porting and adoption. Second, we've been spending our time helping multiple good existing wallets (and exchanges, and other products) integrate Zcash. Second, specia...

All I can say is that I'm beginning to do trading and I picked zcash to invest in. I really need the freshest information I can get. I need as much information about future developments and partnerships as possible.

Then you are in the right place, this is really the only venue besides the _private_ channels that the Development team uses. The rest is announced as it is ready to go public on the Blog.
And of course GitHub (where they work on the codebase)
zerocashcool 1:07 PM
It's been difficult for me. I made an investment one month ago expecting the 1.0.11 release to bump the price. I thought it would be released within 24 hours. One month later, well... I've been watching the whole Internet for updates constantly. It's difficult for me being provided with grossly inaccurate release estimations. I'm a computer scientist and I'm aware of the situation for programmers and ETA, however I would really appreciate it if the programmers would work on analyzing/communicating ETAs more accurately and verbosely. It would really mean the world to me. Other traders too to be certain.
Any chance I can get in on the private channel(s), muted?

@lolitha you can mine to t-addresses with Flypool just fine. You can't use z-address because pool doesn't pay to private addresses.

Hi Guys, nice to meet you
zerocashcool 5:41 AM
Hello! 🙂
babbevdan 5:50 AM
Just a quick question: To shield a transaction one must only send it to a z-address, right?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:57 AM
@babbevdan shielded transactions are where you send from a z-addr to a z-addr. They have full privacy
If you send from a t-addr to a z-addr, the recipient will be private, but the amount won't be (because your transparent inputs will be visible)
babbevdan 5:57 AM
Right. Thanks
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:58 AM
(the latter is called a "shielding transaction")
babbevdan 5:59 AM
So, anonymizing your balance is only a matter of sending to a z-addr. Thanks
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:59 AM
Correct. Once the balance is in a z-addr, from that point it can be used privately
Note that sending to a z-addr and then back to a t-addr is not sufficient on its own to break the link between two t-addrs
because someone could trivially compare the original and final transparent values between the two transactions, and see they only differ by fee amounts
babbevdan 6:01 AM
Well, one just adds noise to the outputs and uses multiple addresses then
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:02 AM
Correct, that's why I said "not sufficient on its own"
You'd either noise it, or unshield in integer values
End goal though is to make z-addrs seamless enough that you can just keep all your balance there 🙂
babbevdan 6:04 AM
Side question: Will Poloniex allow me to withdraw to a z-address, if they have to calculate the zk proof for me?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:04 AM
Some services allow that; I don't think Poloniex is one of them yet
babbevdan 6:05 AM
Right
I'll check on that
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:06 AM
The payment offloading feature I've been implementing should make it much easier for services to support z-addrs, by enabling them to have a dedicated high-powered machine for proving
babbevdan 6:06 AM
Further, since the balance of the z-addresses is not visible on the blockchain how does one sees his balance, if he is not keeping a local record of the transactions?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:07 AM
You cannot see the balance of a particular z-addr without scanning the entire block chain
Specifically, for every output note in every shielded (or shielding) transaction in every block, you have to try and decrypt it
If you *can*, then that note is yours, and you can add it to your balance
babbevdan 6:08 AM
So to see the z-addr balance I can do it with my private keys only
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:08 AM
(And once you know notes that are yours, you can detect when they are spent, and can deduct them from your balance accordingly)
Correct
You can detect incoming notes just with a viewing key (not yet implemented in the main codebase), but that doesn't let you detect spends
So the Sprout version of Zcash requires that you possess the spending key for a z-address to see an accurate balance.
(or otherwise be informed about the nullifiers corresponding to notes, which is the strategy I'm thinking of going with to enable a watching/offline split for Sprout)
babbevdan 6:16 AM
How computationally expensive is to check my z-addr balance, if I have to try to decrypt every shielded transaction. Sounds like a lot of work for me...
Once the blockchain grows, wouldn't it be very expensive to decrypt every shielded transaction in every block?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:21 AM
@babbevdan it is relatively expensive, and if you have multiple z-addrs then the cost scales linearly with those too. Currently it requires a curve multiplication, a KDF call, and a trial decryption, for each pair of [transaction ciphertext, z-addr].
We have ideas for Sapling that we are exploring, which would reduce the computational complexity of balance tracking.
Also note that if you generated the z-addr, then you have knowledge of the point in the block chain before which you don't need to scan 🙂
babbevdan 6:24 AM
Hmm, If I decide to run a service, the ZCash equivalent of blockchain.info/wallet I would need some massive servers...
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:26 AM
Not necessarily. Trial decryption isn't *that* expensive (it's on the order of milliseconds), but it's certainly slower than plain address comparison used for t-addrs
babbevdan 6:26 AM
And it scales linearly with the z-addr transactions made on the network
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:27 AM
Correct, but that's the same as any block chain
(ie. time to identify your t-address or Bitcoin balance scales linearly with the number of transparent transactions, which in Bitcoin's case is directly proportional to the size of the block chain)
babbevdan 6:28 AM
Right, of course
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:29 AM
What we want to do is make the checking process per-transaction as cheap as possible, which is one of the design paths we are investigating for the Sapling upgrade
babbevdan 6:30 AM
It's definitely needed
Also, I read that you are trying to decrease the computation time of the zk-proof - best of luck with that 🙂

Hi everyone. I'm installing zcash to create a wallet and am confused as to whether I'm required to add mainnet=1 and addnode=mainnet.z.cash or whatever? I will not be doing any mining, only creating a wallet and sending/receiving funds. Thanks!
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:25 AM
@zerocashcool no need to add `mainnet=1`, that's the default. The addnode is not necessary (the DNS seeders will bootstrap), but it's a well-connected node so could help
zerocashcool 2:30 AM
So, adding addnode=mainnet.z.cash would help in DNS resolution or some such? It's a good thing to add?
^ @str4d

It does nothing for DNS resolution, it just means you're connecting to a node that is definitely there and knows a lot of other nodes

There it is written that the ceremony must be performed again when you want to update the ZCash protocol

What kind of a change to the protocol is not compatible with the current parameters- is it something equivalent to a hard fork in Bitcoin?

Hi! I'm giving a brief "rump session" talk tomorrow at CRYPTO'17, about the state of Zcash and libsnark. I would like to cite the latest "vital statistics" about Zcash. What's available? In particular, I had in mind:
Technical:
* @lustro's stats at https://explorer.zcha.in/, especially block height, total #transactions, shielded #transactions
* Downloads of the software and params. @radix42, is it still ">1000 downloads/day of Zcash for Windows"? Do we have S3 stats for the params downloads?
* GitHub fork count at https://github.com/zcash/zcash/ (it's 676!)
* Up-to-date node maps/statistics. @lustro, is https://explorer.zcha.in/network reliable?, @str4d, https://mainnet.z.cash (@str4d?) seems down
Ecosystem:
* Exchanges - there's https://zcashblog.wordpress.com/zcash-exchanges/ from May 2017, is there some updated list / Wiki?
* Nonprofits, merchants and payment processors accepting Zcash - what are good lists?
@zooko @cin @amiller @paige @mineZcash: Would be good to have a Wiki page (or some such), systematically collecting these "vital stats" pointers.

@tromer my dnsseeder shows 682 "good" nodes (ie. ones it will distributed via dnsseed.str4d.xyz)
Out of just under 3400 known nodes
tromer Zcash Foundation 9:13 AM
What's wrong with the rest? Too old version, or firewalled/NATted?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:16 AM
I think it depends on whether the seeder can connect to them
Oh, and also their view of the network
There's a bunch of rules:

```
  bool IsGood() const {
    if (ip.GetPort() != GetDefaultPort()) return false;
    if (!(services & NODE_NETWORK)) return false;
    if (!ip.IsRoutable()) return false;
    if (clientVersion && clientVersion < REQUIRE_VERSION) return false;
    if (blocks && blocks < GetRequireHeight()) return false;

    if (total <= 3 && success * 2 >= total) return true;

    if (stat2H.reliability > 0.85 && stat2H.count > 2) return true;
    if (stat8H.reliability > 0.70 && stat8H.count > 4) return true;
    if (stat1D.reliability > 0.55 && stat1D.count > 8) return true;
    if (stat1W.reliability > 0.45 && stat1W.count > 16) return true;
    if (stat1M.reliability > 0.35 && stat1M.count > 32) return true;

    return false;
  }

```

First three are just connectivity (since requesting through DNS, only get access to the IP)
A block height requirement isn't yet enforced, so the rest is just reliability

Question, What does one need to do to setup another main net node to help the network in adding an extra level of redundancy?
MrRenegade 3:03 PM
Basicly I'd like to turn that section that says Connections = 8 into connections = 10
unless of course thats a hard coded value to not exceed 8 connections, which in that case I would still like to provide my services
sterling 4:42 PM
@MrRenegade you can configure that in your `~/.zcash/zcash.conf` add this line to that file: `maxconnections=10`and restart zcashd
anarch3 7:30 PM
maxconnections is 125 by default, dont change that
you have to port forward 8133 to get more than 8 connections

Hello!! I am new here. Can somebody explain to me what XCAT essentially do?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:58 AM
I @imauser XCAT will allow for cross chain atomic swaps, trading directly between Zcash and Bitcoin, or Zcash and Ethereum without a middle man
No exchange or changer needed

They are going to be giving a live demo of it soon on the next Zcash show and tell

oh yeah I am reading about it right now, so has it been implemented? Like Litecoin and bitcoin will be using lightning network for cross chain transaction. How is zcash approach different?

okay so since there is a demo tomorrow, this is implemented and possible. Cool. Is zcash the first blockchain to make it possible with bitcoin and ethereum?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:11 AM
I believe Zcash will be the first to offer direct ETH-ZEC and ZEC-BTC swaps. The code is still very Beta right now, but it can be implemented with refinements

@grewalsatinder Hi, welcome to the chat. I don't believe the Zcash team claimed to be exclusive with this tech. I think it is cool that there is another version that is available. The Zcash version is open source and free to tinker with, so if barterdex can use the code they are welcome to.
As you mentioned in the #zcash-communications channel, there may be room for collaboration too
grewalsatinder 7:46 AM
Glad to hear :)
yes, I think since both teams are working on same things, both teams can def benefit from each other

grewalsatinder 7:54 AM
from core protocol point of view, the bitcoin talk post that jl777 shared is interesting
I think this channel is connected to your previous Zcash Slack?
and the previous Zcash Slack is connected to SuperNET's Slack?
I don't know the details, but if Rocket Chat and SuperNET's slack channels can be connected, that would be super amazing and very convenience for both teams 🙂
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:56 AM
Yes, this has replaced the open Slack, I have a bridge to IRC, freenode, superNET
grewalsatinder 7:56 AM
I'm just glad you considering this 🙂
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:58 AM
I am not a developer, so I can't speak directly for them. But I do know that is why @zooko wanted to get the code out there sooner rather than later. We can all benefit from the knowledge of others
grewalsatinder 7:59 AM

Ok I'm beginning to understand: https://www.supernet.org/en/technology/whitepapers/barterdex-a-practical-native-dex#atomic-cross-chain-protocol
What's seems a slight disadvantage is that Alice has to expose an actual private key in the spend, and not just a hash preimage that's not a key.. but maybe that's not a big deal

Btw as a sidenote, there was a point where I thought "hmm maybe there's no point in us doing xcat cause supernet has done it" but your references and code are so hard to understand (e.g David Mercer had a hard time understanding where the xcat is and what's going in)

Also @grewalsatinder another question to jl777 https://www.supernet.org/en/technology/whitepapers/barterdex-a-practical-native-dex#atomic-cross-chain-protocol says
"In case step 2 never happens, Bob is able to recoup his bobdeposit (at any time) By recouping his deposit, Bob divulges to Alice how to spend the alicepayment."
But looking at the scipt for Bob deposit, it seems Bob can recoup his deposit also after step 2 happened, so I don't see what it accomplishes

OK one question @jl777, it seems a con of using private keys as secrets, is that you need the private key format to be the same on both chains. Is this correct?

It seems the advantage this protocol has, is that it makes Bob have to pay to DOS Alice, on the other hand Bob needs to already have X bitcoin for deposit, to buy another X bitcoin
[superNET/grewalsatinder] @rocket.cat Bot 12:05 PM
@jl777
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:07 PM
yes, the deposit needs to be a bit bigger than the payment
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:07 PM
alice cant be spamming without paying the dexfee, which is counterproductive and will lose money
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:08 PM
the bob side needs to have utxo ready to go and have an extra deposit, so being a more "stationary" participant, if bob starts misbehaving, well alice will start claiming the deposits
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:09 PM
the 2of2 multisig needs to be secp256k1
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:10 PM
the privkey is not the wif string, but the actual binary 256bit privkey, which are all compatible if constrained to secp256k1
arielg 12:36 PM
@jl777 What forces Alice to pay the dexfee and who is it payed to? This dexfee does not seem to be in the description in the whitepaper
[superNET/jl777] August 26, 2017 12:07 PM
alice cant be spamming without paying the dexfee, which is counterproductive and will lose money
So is there an example of an xcat done between Zcash and bitcoin using this protocol on testnet or mainnet? Do you have links to the transactions?
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:38 PM
the protocol forces the payment. Bob side wont respond if there isnt a dexfee paid, it goes into a hardcoded address. In order to prevent certain attacks, a fee must be paid that is more than the odds of randomly getting one of the 1000 sets of cut and choose keypairs
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:39 PM
not sure if we ever did any ZEC/BTC, but we did KMD/BTC and also KMD/ZEC. I can see if the testers can dig up the txids for ZEC atomic swaps
arielg 12:39 PM
This hardcoded address belongs to BarterDEX? How much is the fee typically?
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:40 PM
1/777 of the tx amount
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:40 PM
yes the address is revshared to owners of the DEX asset
arielg 12:40 PM
Cool
Dn18 12:41 PM
Has joined the channel.
arielg 12:41 PM
And I didn't understand why there was a need to choose 1000 key pairs. What goes wrong if Alice and Bob both choose one random key for the protocol?
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:42 PM
I asked the testers to dig up the txids for ZEC atomic swaps, hopefully they will find a set. we are doing so many atomic swaps, we are past looking at each set of txids, but it is all stored locally
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:43 PM
there is a possible attack where alice can send a false keypair, so there needs to be a fee that makes such an attack counterproductive. In the bitcointalk thread, Tier Nolan explains the rationale behind it
arielg 12:44 PM
So what is the most common types of swaps? i.e. which pair of coins
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:44 PM
right now we are qualifying coins, so just making sure the coin supports the protocol. A surprising number dont have the gettxout rpc call and I rely on that
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:45 PM
KMD is the most common coin traded due to, well, we are KMD peoples
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 12:45 PM
http://5.9.253.204:7779/api/stats/getcoins has the list of coins
arielg 12:54 PM
@jl777 Are they bitcoin clones? We parse it out of the transaction json without an rpc call

Hi Guys
Are there any online wallets that support z-addresses?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:25 PM
Hi @babbevdan there are no online services that support private transactions yet
As the processing of the transactions become more efficient I believe more Vendors will support them
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 3:27 PM
the big issue is privacy and also privkey management
esrett 4:07 PM
Has joined the channel.
babbevdan 4:09 PM
@rocket.cat private key management can be solved in blockchain.info wallet style
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:10 PM
but how to maintain privacy?
babbevdan 4:10 PM
They store an encrypted version of your priv key on their servers. To login you download the encrypted file via js and perform decryption and all further operations on your machine
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:11 PM
i didnt know they had a zksnark library in js
babbevdan 4:12 PM
They have no zksnark lib- but one could be developed following this methodology
no private key nor any transaction info ever touches their servers
only an encrypted -with your pass - version of the private key
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:13 PM
but this server will know the ip address that requested the encrypted privkey
babbevdan 4:14 PM
sure they will
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:14 PM
i just dont see how privacy can be maintained using a web wallet, even if you can actually locally do all the zksnark calcs in js
babbevdan 4:14 PM
but in the 21st century there are many ways to protect your IP 😃
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:15 PM
a long road to develop and the end result will create a definite external correlation event
babbevdan 4:16 PM
It's surely not 100% confidential. But it's good enough for most cases
If one wants full privacy he is free to use the desktop wallets
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:20 PM
my point is that a webwallet has some serious privacy issues, so why not just a transparent mode webwallet?
babbevdan 4:24 PM
Because what will kickoff zcash as a currency is the ease of use of its private functionality
And most of the privacy problems (not all) can be tackled it the above way
We need to start from somewhere

@jl777: I still don't understand: How does Bob know the right value of hash(alice_privM). So far he's only seen alice_pubM, how does he know Alice sent him the correct value?
Do you prefer I join the supernet slack or pm there?
Ohh Now I see that's why you need a 1000, if Alice tries bogus values she will be caught w.h.p
Cool
Though since the key selection is before any deposits, couldn't Alice try 1000 times to cheat by a bogus value hash(alice_privM) until she succeeds?
I guess she would need to do it with different identities, to avoid being blocked
But still, one could argue it's a lot of work to avoid using cltv. So are there actual cryptocurrencies, with multisig and no cltv that make it worth the effort?
And even if there are, for the cases where both sides have ctlv, maybe it's better to use the simpler 4 tx version we have?

that is why there is a fee required, so alice ends up paying more in fees than she can get by guessing 1000 times and it doesnt matter if she changes identities
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 9:23 AM
the 2of2 multisig is good not just for older bitcoin forks, but for non-bitcoin coins. Much much easier to get a 2of2 multisig than the entire CLTV and hashlock opcode functionality

[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 9:38 AM
certainly uneconomic attacks are possible, but if we can ignore losing money then that opens up a whole lot of attack vectors. Practically speaking, if the system cant be gamed to generate a positive ROI, only an irractional actor would bother to do this. If this indeed becomes a real issue, then it can be addresses in several ways, also if a bob that has been targeted simply refuses to do trades with newbie addresses, then only addresses with a good history can be used for this, once. Really it seems like a lot of work to make bob lose some money

nathan Electric Coin Company 9:34 PM
@rogach Maybe try `importaddress` for the addresses you are interested in. You probably need to do at least `-rescan` after doing that.
I don't recall if that requires `txindex=1` or not.

@nathan Tried that, failed.

Still getting 0.0 balance in that wallet.
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:44 AM
do an importaddress for addresses not in the wallet
rogach 4:45 AM
Did that: `zcash-cli importaddress t1KstPVzcNEK4ZeauQ6cogoqxQBMDSiRnGr rescan`
(that's definitely not in my wallet, it's Coinmine's address)
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:49 AM
with txindex=1, importaddress that scanned the chain, it should be able to display the balance at least indirectly via listunspent and summing the utxo
[superNET/jl777] @rocket.cat Bot 4:49 AM
it wouldnt go to spendable balance that z_getbalance returns
rogach 4:53 AM
Tried `zcash-cli listunspent 0 100 '["t1KstPVzcNEK4ZeauQ6cogoqxQBMDSiRnGr"]'`, got empty array.
`zcash-cli listtransactions t1KstPVzcNEK4ZeauQ6cogoqxQBMDSiRnGr` also gives empty array.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:06 AM
@rogach you won't see any balance until the relevant blocks have downloaded

@str4d Oh. That's a long wait 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:08 AM
txindex is not necessary for watch addresses
txindex just lets you look up arbitrary transactions
Also when using the Bitcoin-inherited APIs, make sure to set includeWatchOnly to 1 to see them
rogach 5:14 AM
@str4d Thanks!
`zcash-cli listtransactions t1KstPVzcNEK4ZeauQ6cogoqxQBMDSiRnGr 10000000 0 true` still gives nothing, but all blocks are not downloaded yet.
(includeWatchonly seems to take booleans, not integers)

Hi, I started building a 13 gpu rig for Zcash and have got some HW related question which doesn't allow me to sleep - my rig consisted of two cards 1080 Ti Aorus - randomly one card always lost connection when mining. It was in 5 mins after starting the rig or after 12 hours. Now I have got 3 cards and it happens either. I swapped the riser positions, I checked multiple times whether the power cables are correctly attached, but still the card randomly loses connection and I have to restart the rig. WIth the 3 cards it is more often. Only I have to restart or in device manager restrict and again allow the device. Do you have an idea for a solution?

If you are into Zcash to make money all I can advise you is to not invest more than you can afford to lose. All crypto-currencys are a high risk investment.

mineZcash Admin Owner 5:13 PM
Looks like to get $100 a day you will need about 20,000 Solutions/sec. So, that would be about 27 GeForce GTX1080ti Graphics cards (not counting electrical costs)
That's assuming the difficulty is constant, which only seems to go up over time.

https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=Bha29sfHWKDRdHJLo The approach @rogach is taking also has much better privacy because zcha.in can see which addresses a client is interested in.
mineZcash August 29, 2017 10:28 AM
Why not just use Zchains API to query address balances that you don't own?
@rogach I recall having trouble getting a watch-only address to work, and later I was able to get it to work by starting a _new node_ with `txindex=1` in the config file from the first start. I may have made some other mistake or missed some detail, but I suspect there's a bug.

After that, `importaddress` worked for several minutes, and `listunspent` after gave me list of stuff. But using that on other addresses later still failed to work.

Simple question - Zcash is supposedly a team of world class Scientists, Engineers in cryptography correct? If so how come these "Smart" minds come up with new innovations to improve Zcash ecosystem rather than relying on Foundation Grants & other 3rd part sources? I realise it's open source but surely the team are capable to innovate new technologies internally & with the founders reward they have the financial resources to carry them out?

    June 16, 2017 - Dev update
    Hi Austin, I'm largely responsible for the fact that ZcashCo has not initiated a wallet development effort. Why? There are several reasons: First and most fundamental, opportunity costs: We've been busy at work on a few key things: first, a new protocol (codenamed Sapling) which will have incredible benefits, including for porting and adoption. Second, we've been spending our time helping multiple good existing wallets (and exchanges, and other products) integrate Zcash. Second, specia...

mineZcash Admin Owner 5:47 AM
It's a matter of resources, the goal of a decentralized community and the fact that the Foundation was set up for that purpose. You're also implying that they aren't innovating internally which is not correct. There are several ongoing projects that are improving Zcash https://github.com/zcash/zcash/projects

[OFTC/kewde[m]] @rocket.cat Bot 5:57 AM
It makes a lot more sense to give out grants IMO, they enable the community to create zcash related software, often cheaper than you can do it yourself. Sure you could hire the best experts in the field, but how long will they stick around? Are they really dedicated to the project? Coins that come into existence through ICO, private funding etc, have a tendency to work more privately. There's nothing inherently wrong with that, it's quite
[OFTC/kewde[m]] @rocket.cat Bot 5:57 AM
efficient but cryptocurrencies are ment to survive the test of time. That involves growing a dedicated community, with passionate people, willing to sacrifice their free time to help around. A bit of funding won't hurt them 😉

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:02 AM
I agree kewde, it's important that Zcash forms a community that is also passionate about the project. I think the Grant program is a good way to incentivise developers who may not be interested in a larger commitment with Zcash Company but still wish to contribute with some compensation.
crypto.world 6:06 AM
Yes everyone understands the team created ZnSnarks & with Sapling & the recent Atomic swaps to come, I would argue if the team can work on such exciting technology, why cant they come up with developing its own cold storage wallets with Z-addresses, or digital cards for debit/withdrawals from Bitcoin ATM's or any other by-products that will improve the Zcash ecosystem, Im thinking if the team can come up with ZnSnarks surely they have the talent, know how, resources to work on these what appears to be more simple , easier developments? The market in return clearly doesn't believing Zcash, it was Market Cap in top 10 very recently yet continually plummeting down to 18-19 now with many new ICO's , tokens Im assuming who have little or minimal knowledge of cryptography yet they have surpassed Zcash in value (Market Cap)...clearly something is amiss.
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:14 AM
Things like Credit cards, ATMs etc.. require a lot of development and there are companies out there that already do those things far more efficient than the core team could. Protocol improvements will pave the way for wider adoption with more RPC and API functionality and less demanding computation.
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:21 AM
I also think Market Cap is an extremely poor way to measure the "Value" of a coin, those numbers are constantly skewed by several factors like ICOs that have nothing but a fancy website and a white paper, limited supply of coins, etc.. a savvy investor looks beyond simple numbers on paper like this article I read the other day: https://medium.com/@muneeb/5-star-system-6c27a0eb4a1c

It's just not their pot of tea to go around and build everything, they already have their hand plentyful with the protocol, the cryptography etc.. "Improving the ecosystem" does not mean "build the ecosystem yourself" 😛 An ecosystem is just that, other people doing things that work in symbiosis wit hwhat you're doing. The grants will do just that exactly.

And as far as e.g. cold storage wallets go, we *are* working on the Zcash side of things (that require interfacing with the zk-SNARK tech), which will make it significantly easier for third parties to implement.

Yep, Sapling will make hardware wallets with shielded tx support so much more practical
If we can get Trezor and Ledger to support Sapling, that would be better for users, as well as happening much faster, than developing our own hardware wallet -- and I think you're vastly underestimating the engineering resources needed for the latter, @crypto.world

rahul 7:38 AM
@qinjunbo @mineZcash it is very confusing about Hash rate and sol rate. I looked up on internet and it says 1 sol = 1 hash. but my computer gives me about 40 khash rate for other mining and 40 "sol" rate for zcash. which implies 1 sol = 1 khash. What is the appropriate here?
lory 7:38 AM
coz don't know how tx is created want to be sure
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:39 AM
@lory have a read through this https://z.cash/blog/transaction-linkability.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Transaction Linkability

Zcash uses Equihash Algo, measured in Solutions per Second. Other coins like ETH use different algorithms measured in Hash or kHash
The correct term is Sols/s to measure "hash power" . It is confusing because many people still think of Mining as "Hashing" but in Zcash Mining is actually "Solving"
https://z.cash/blog/why-equihash.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Why Equihash?

rahul 7:46 AM
yeah that I read somewhere, so basically it is not right to try to convert from hash to sols or vice versa because they are not comparable, right?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:51 AM
Yes, there is not and accurate direct conversation I know of. But I have noticed some websites and software that has been adapted to Zcash from another coin still call it hashrate, which kinda adds to the confusion
Like, I believe Claymore or Optiminer still say "hash" in the terminal when running Zcash

Mining sir. I am trying to build zcash from source.

Do you plan on using the imbedded Zcash miner or third party software?

What OS?
captnkoch 2:37 PM
GPU 2x Nvidia Tesla P100 Ubuntu 16.04.2
I was planning on using the embedded (I think it's called zcashd no?)
the bit during build where it tries to guess the build type is where it's failing at the moment. I just don't want to start asking for help in the wrong place. I looked at the dev channel but doesn't seem to be support related.
okanaganrusty 3:11 PM
@captnkoch Pastebin the build logs so we can see where it's failing.
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:20 PM
@captnkoch to make use of your GPUs you will need to get third party software. The embedded miner is CPU only
https://www.zcashcommunity.com/mining/zcash-mining-software/

GPUs are much more efficient than CPUs. So if you are just planning on Mining with that machine look into that software too

sorry i mean 0
I tried LTC on Jaxx, was successful
I even do not see the payment in transaction history
pala4pala 3:56 PM
mineZcash = I still do not see any balance not even history
i also tried sending another tranasction
have this happened before?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:00 PM
This is not usually an issue, since it is the Jaxx wallet and Trezor your best bet will be to contact thier customer service department
I can't really help you here, sorry
pala4pala 4:01 PM
Sure mate.
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:02 PM
Don't worry too much, the coins are in the chain in an address that Jaxx made, so as long as you have the private keys you can always import them to a different wallet if you need to
pala4pala 4:06 PM
what's the best wallet for zcash?
i will try to do it now
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:15 PM
Which Operating system?
pala4pala 4:16 PM
Windows
I downloaded the z4win one
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:16 PM
Do you want to run a full node, or just a wallet?
pala4pala 4:16 PM
shall i just import my private key?
from the GUI?
import one private key?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:18 PM
Yes, you can do that. Remember the first time it will take quite a bit of time to download the entire Blockchain. It has to be 100% synced before you will see the balance after you import your address/Key
pala4pala 4:18 PM
Sure mate
I'll give it a try.
Thanks for your help 🙂
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:20 PM
No problem 🤓
pala4pala 4:36 PM

Hi guys and girls. A few short questions about ZCash, for a demo tomorrow:
-Why the fee on shielded transactions seems to be higher (0.0001 VS. 0.00000226 )
-Why new address is generated in each transparent transaction?
-Why when shielded transactions are pending it seems the private wallet is empty (0 ZEC)?
Thanks in advance

That's important for indistinguishability

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:52 PM
The transparent fee you saw was calculated using an algorithm inherited from Bitcoin
michael-r 4:52 PM
I see, on the blockchain it seems high, but actually it is lower
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:53 PM
No, it is higher
Numerically, shielded transaction users are paying more in that example. But they might also sometimes be paying less
The problem with doing variable fees is, the fee amount becomes an identifier
It adds a way for an outside observer to distinguish between different transactions, in a way that leaks information (about which wallet was used to generate the transaction)
That's bad for privacy
So instead, we default to the same 0.0001 ZEC fee for every transaction created using `z_sendmany`
michael-r 4:55 PM
So, if I understand correctly, the fee for shielded transaction is defined deterministically in some way, and identical to all transaction done in the same time. Is that right?
And than return some of it back?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:55 PM
No
The fee is the fee paid
michael-r 4:56 PM
OK
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:57 PM
Now, there may be better ways to calculate this fee - e.g. it might make more sense to have a fixed fee rate, instead of a fixed fee. But the point is, everyone needs to do exactly the same thing, or else those who do something different lose privacy
michael-r 4:58 PM
I understand, thanks a lot for that! could you please help me with the additional 2?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:58 PM
- A new transparent address is generated for each transaction, because that's what Bitcoin did
michael-r 4:59 PM
fair enough 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:59 PM
We inherited that behaviour from Bitcoin - it was an attempt to add privacy to Bitcoin. In practice it doesn't help much, but it does make it more costly to figure things out
- If you're sending all your private balance (or the transaction uses all your private notes), then yes while the transaction is in the mempool your balance is zero
This is an implementation detail - at present, we don't track new notes that are in the mempool, and this includes change notes in transactions you have just created
michael-r 5:01 PM
But I noised this even when I sent a part of my private balance 😕
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:02 PM
Right - that will have been part of the balance, but used all your private notes
Every transaction (transparent and private) effectively destroys old coins/notes and makes new ones
michael-r 5:02 PM
I see, thank you very much Jack! you were super helpful!
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:03 PM
We may be able to improve the UX in a future release, by maybe caching the change notes we generate, but there are some intricacies that make it not as trivial as for transparent change
np! Happy to explain things 🙂
michael-r 5:04 PM
Thanks 🙂

Hi all, I do not know if this is the right place for my question. I read all the FAQ and the user guide and I only found this information https://z.cash/blog/funding.html. I would like to know what is the monetary policy of Zcash and what is the supply rate per year. Since Zcash is very close to bitcoin and for the latter, 99.9% of the currency will be circulating on 2044, how is the same estimate for Zcash? Thank you
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:35 AM

libsnark dependency used in the zcash repo on github does fail checksum verification after downloading the tarball. what is going on on github??
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:40 AM
@ca333 you can see the discussion about a checksum issue here: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2608

    github.com
    Fix "Result: None" on download page. · Issue #2608 · zcash/zcash
    The download page for the binary tarball currently instructs users to verify the sha256sum and compare it against "Result: None". There's probably some automation that has broken which updates this...

ca333 9:40 AM
according to https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/depends/packages/libsnark.mk - the historic tarball with the commit hash 9ada3f84ab484c57b2247c2f41091fd6a0916573 must result in the sha256 checksum dad153fe46e2e1f33557a195cbe7d69aed8b19ed9befc08ddcb8c6d3c025941f. instead it results in 93eafebf315651006a37d086341e34b8e73bc33701157e77d9a423d99a7bec24

thank you for the useless info @mineZcash - but what do you mean with checksum issue? there should NEVER be a checksum issue.
no offend - this is irritating. checksum should stay unchanged in any case. So no one is aware of *why* it has changed?
is this what you trying to tell me? - what guarantees that the tarballs have not been infiltrated with malware or other sort of harming software?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:43 AM
I don't know enough about the tarball to help, perhaps @str4d would know better @nathan
I'm not a developer, just community manager
ca333 9:43 AM
i as an it security expert have problems to just accept the answer "the checksum just changed" - but on that github issue post you refer me to - nobody has an idea. it is being talked about "maybe an automation has changed...." - there should still never change data. this means the legacy data has been modified in any way.
ok thank you for the help.
can you please forward this info to one of the developers. this is important. NOBODY should just change it to the new checksum without knowing why a history commits data has changed.
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:44 AM
I have posted your question in the developers channel, they should see it and get back to you
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:46 AM
It *shouldn't* have changed. We haven't changed the libsnark version for several releases

@mineZcash Hi, thank your for your reply. Is there any expected year for 99.9% of circulating coins? Some spreadsheets like this for bitcoin https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12tR_9WrY0Hj4AQLoJYj9EDBzfA38XIVLQSOOOVePNm0/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true?

i contacted github and am waiting for reply - do you have any source for the info @str4d
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:54 AM
I have just downloaded the libsnark file from both GitHub and our servers. Our servers are consistent
Likely this was not seen previously because we default to fetching dependencies from our servers and falling back to the original source
ca333 9:57 AM
ok i see - well if you fall back to github the issue would occure as well - and the source is still being hosted there which most of the devs prefer to get tarbals from. it is just very suspicious and i hope github has no problems.

https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=queAg2zi4kEnQoRwZ Sorry for the confusion. I recommend _not_ falling back to github in this case, and instead downloading the tarball from z.cash/downloads, since that matches the hash in our zcash codebase. Is my understanding correct? Meanwhile, we need to understand what changed in github, and how often such changes may occur, since we rely on that for source dependencies.

hello all, just joined up. I've been watching Z-Cash in freefal for about 4 months now. At one point in the past, maybe about a month ago, I did a little research and heard some bad news which may or may not have been true. But since Zcash had been bleeding so badly and for so long I figured it was probably true. And now, after much more blood I figure its gotta be about bled out, plus the huge green candle, and some good news about ZCash in the media. The bad news I heard long ago was commentary from a former zcash developer on twitter saying that zcash was not anonymous, or something like that, think he may have mentioned a back door also. Sorry for bringing it up if its b.s. , but I wont know if I dont ask. Thx

Thank you mineZcash for that informative article. That was just what I needed. I have faith in Zcash now. I figured it was probably b.s. Sorry for Zcash hodlers who've suffered a bit, but at least it presented an opportunity for me, and you too, to buy more cheap Zcash. I would like to add though, however, that it is my belief that if you are seeing more and more misinformation in various areas than it is the fault of non other than Zcash themselves. The Zcash team must see it this way too if they are to overcome it. Don't be a victim, empower yourselves. Take the fight to them, whenever, and wherever, until they all stand corrected, and disappointed they missed out!

@marbella_broker It's around 6.2GB to download for the blockchain alone, and then there's the proving key (869MB). Plus additional data such as chainstate (around 700MB), so that's a *minimum* of ~8GB that you'd need right now.

Hi @coinqwest, I don't quite understand your question. If you want to create a new altcoin based on the Zcash codebase, that's quite doable. I actually have quite a few requests for new source-forks of Zcash, though, to improve user safety across systems.
Some examples are: change the address encoding prefix (so users won't confuse Zcash addresses with the new coin's addresses), change the p2p magic numbers (so peers won't accidentally connect), change the config path from ~/.zcash to something else so users who run both Zcash and the new altcoin won't accidentally use the same wallet datadir, etc…
We should make a checklist…
Of course, you could always submit patches to Zcash itself. 😉
https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=DBLhbcHEiPafukr2u Which crypto-contract platform are you referring to? When I hear DAPP, I think of Ethereum. Is that the platform you're targeting, or are you looking for any blockchain that can meet your privacy requirements?
mylord September 13, 2017 11:42 PM
My DAPP requires that a "manager" of the crypto-contract would be able to do things that while others involved in the same contract would not know the details.

Is the privacy crypto-contract platform you're working on able to do this? What's the roadmap for it's release?

@x-1 Your best bet is to have a good coin with active development and a in-demand use case. If people want it, exchanges will list it because they know they can make commission. Though, I not sure why you are asking this in the Zcash chat.

Type in your txID, and you should see it
Also, check the bottom right corner of the Zcash4mac GUI and see if it says 100% synced
slobalucy 4:15 PM
ok ill try now
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:15 PM
If it's not synced, it won't show
slobalucy 4:16 PM
says not valid

Not a valid txID?
Or address?

how do i know when its fullu synced?

mineZcash September 18, 2017 4:15 PM
Also, check the bottom right corner of the Zcash4mac GUI and see if it says 100% synced
So the funds show on the chain, now it just a matter of waiting for the wallet to see it
slobalucy 4:23 PM
ah ty, only when i expand the view do i see that its only 57% synced thank you

No, it has to be running to sync

@alexunder anyone can send you ZEC, from a transparent or shielded address. If they send to you from a transparent address, then the transaction will be transparent. If they send to you from a shielded address, then only the amount you receive will be public.
alexunder 2:28 PM
thanks, so i can never see the origin of the transaction
even if i am the recipient

alexunder 5:53 AM
ok thanks
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:57 AM
@mineZcash hmm, sending to a t-addr, the memo fields may not be as usable because they are for dummy notes

    ☑ 1 

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:06 AM
Ah, good point @str4d
alexunder 6:14 AM
@str4d so from a shielded address to a transparent one you can't use the memo field?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:15 AM
No, because each memo field is encrypted to a shielded address
Transparent addresses don't have memo fields. At most, you could store some tag in an OP_RETURN maybe
The sender *could* put data in there anyway and then later reveal it (because it's just dummy data for a z -> t transaction), but that would be something we don't currently support

david-1 7:01 AM
@mineZcash In Helperbit you will be able to donate to a single project/charity, but when a natural disaster will happen you will have the opportunity to split your donation to many beneficiaries that have been affected (organizations or single users). Using manually shapeshift this process is quite long, while integrating flyp.me you will do that with one single click

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:06 AM
I see, don't get me wrong, I'm all for more simple methods of donating to charitable causes. I'm sure it's entirely coincidental that the ICO is in a few days and this press release is being posted in every single sub Reddit and Slack.
david-1 7:15 AM
Well, in my opinion this would be a simple method. Better go directly to the project, select the currency and donate (and track in the bitcoin blockchain the path) than go in shapeshift and copy and paste the address. Few days ago Helperbit released another important news regarding the donations made with credit/debit card. All these methods of payment allow to increase the donor base, so more people will benefit from this. This is the most important aspect

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:36 PM
It was just updated, it is maintained by @radix42
And safe
dexplorer 6:43 PM
Both GitHub and S3 state it was last updated 9 months ago and no way to verify binary matches source on GitHub?

Thanks for the response @radix42. Will run that zcash-apple for now and keep an eye out for your updates. Using swing wallet GUI on top of zcash-apple should run pretty similar to zcash4mac if I'm not mistaken?
And thanks for recommendations @mineZcash.

Buying a book on amazon using purse.io with Zcash, you get 15% off. It's pretty nice, you add things to your amazon wish list. make it public, and purse.io connects to it.

@arielg You end up giving your shipping address and shopping list to a stranger, right? Awkward... Anything else revealed to them?

I think Amazon's idea is that it will be public.
Ohh wait it doesn't seem necessary the address is exposed..

@tromer My understanding is that an amazon wish list has a url (that's what you give purse.io).. so if you have that url you can send to the person who's list it is

@gergx As I understand it, ETH will have a pre-compile for computing pairings, which makes it much more efficient to validate zk-SNARKs. However, that is just a tool for dApp developers to use. It doesn't change any existing contracts, and it doesn't add privacy to the base ETH layer

@lustro I just noticed that one of the mining pools is being mis-identified on Zchain, because they are putting the FR address first, and the mining stats code in Zchain appears to pick up the first address - so it's seeing t3Ut4KUq2ZSMTPNE67pBU5LqYCi2q36KpXQ as a mining pool.

bitcartel 12:47 AM
What's the txid of the tx? You might have gotten lucky and the tx did not propagate from your node to the network, and it is only visible on your local machine.
If other folk here can't see the txid in the mempool, and it hasn't been mined, you should be able to create a new tx with higher fee.
Shutting down zcash will flush the mempool of the old tx, and then you can creatre the new one.

Well, every Zcash Block mined is first sent to a private z_address, then whoever found the Block can send to a Z or T Address. Many people mine with pools, or purchase Zcash from Exchanges.
So they receive the Zcash to a transparent address, if they want to then break the history of those coins they can then send the funds to a private address.
Then to maintain the maximum amount of privacy, only use Z_address to Z_address transactions. Every time funds are sent to transparent addresses the privacy is reduced.

Hi

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:43 AM
Are you pool Mining?
glasswool 7:44 AM
no solo mining
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:44 AM
The embedded Zcashd miner doesn't support pool Mining so there are no shares to display

Right now trying to gt used to your proxy...
@sammy007 is here a way to restart frontend without loosing the past history?

sammy007 8:06 AM
@glasswool no there is no way to do it, not needed. once everything is running you can go with it for weeks/months.
glasswool 8:08 AM
@sammy007 and if does start again, listing only new shares, the old ones will make into a block right?
sammy007 8:16 AM
what block? shares worth nothing, just stats. Block is a block.

Cex.io (London) & Bithumb (Seol) have accepted Zcash trading, however I noticed volume of trading is minimal? Two different large regions/continents yet volume is decreased rather than increased, an I missing something?
crypto.world 6:06 AM
Also, with several Exchsnges now trading Zcash, how does one control the "real price" without such a large differential in price fluctuations between each exchanges? For example Exmo - Zec can be at $201 & Kraken - $210 ... I'm assuming with Cex.io & Bithumb will only make this price differential evan a bigger gap?

crypto.world 2:20 PM
Zooko- It's not a Market discussion- im not asking about or interested in Zec prices. The question is technical in nature- Will Zcash develop or have a system so the "Average " price is established across all Exchanges so large price fluctuations are not experienced between all of them?
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:36 PM
At this point in time I don't see a way that any coin could seek to control it's price for so many disparate markets. Thats the nature of localization, there are so many factors like number of people trading on the market, supply available, different currencies, etc...
In the future Cross chain swaps will be possible, but someone will have to come up with a system that will set prices that users are willing to swap for. Even that would be a big task.
rohnin 3:19 PM

crypto.world 3:28 PM
Atomic Swaps is exciting & im hoping it could lead to a more efficient one price "fits all" concept as Zcash is not centrally localised- Perhaps when implemented the Atomic Swaps can mathematically calculate the "Average " price based on all Exchanges current price for Zcash? Just a thought cause as you mentioned MineZcash, the variables for price fluctuations are many but to continue with such disparity will I believe cause greater negativity in the Zcash ecosystem than benefit it....after all Zcash if Global not local.

My concern is the "Value" for Zcash amongst all Exchanges could be significant whereas Investors & or Traders would be naturally "Buying" from the best "Value" (Cheapest) based on whichever Exchange is offering the best value. This type of activity in turn could lead to Exchanges removing Crypto "Pairs" which is what happened recently with Kraken removing Euro/Eos & othe Pairs where liquidity was very thin. If we use a scenario where we have (4) different Exchanges- Kraken , Bithumb, Cex.io, Exmo offering Zcash at US$ as an example - $200, $220, $185, $230 at the same time- there's no mechanism or system to have one price, so in the end the Exchanges will be challenging each other or like Kraken will remove them & im hoping Atomic Swaps Developers or others in Zcash team can remove this "Unfairness" by perhaps having an Algorihmic system to create "one" value system & only then will Zcash value will instill confidence in the ecosystem. @daira

crypto.world 12:30 AM
So if I transfer my Zcash from Bithumb account to my digital wallet at $200 & Zooko transfers his Zcash from Kraken to he's Wallet @ $220 , when sending Atomic Swaps which value do we use? I'd be saving much, much more with Bithumb yet Zooko will have less Zcash cause he's paid an extra $20, see my point?

@crypto.world I don't think there's any inherent problem with exchanges offering different prices for the same currency pair. If I believe that exchange A has probability p of running away with my money and exchange B has probability 10p of doing the same, then I might still use exchange B if it provides a better rate, no?
of course atomic swaps can all but eliminate the "running away with my money" risk, but there will still be other distinguishing factors like latency, limits/thresholds on the size of trades, etc.

hi. im syncing to the blockchain very slowly around 10600 block. takes around 2 minutes for one block
is it normal for the zcashd timer to freeze for upwards of 10 minutes
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:58 AM
@hutyy around the 10000 height there were some very large Blocks with alot of inputs so the first time you sync your node it may take a little bit to get through those blocks
hutyy 6:00 AM
@mineZcash ah, thanks. so it is normal for zcashd to appear to freeze and not mine many blocks?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:00 AM
Your talking about syncing, or Mining?
hutyy 6:00 AM
think there is also a lot of disk usage
syncing
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:01 AM
The current Blockchain size is about 6-7GB
And the node is checking chain integrity as it is syncing, so CPU usage may go up a bit too
hutyy 6:02 AM
yeah, got the first 3GB or so in about 3 hours. now im hardly getting 100 bloxks in an hour
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:03 AM
But once completed, Zcashd takes very little to run in the background
It takes a little while to sync but it will complete, just have to be patient. Some other coins take _days_ to sync a full node
hutyy 6:05 AM
yeah, thanks for the help. just thought I might have a problem as the timer for yncing keeps freezeing

The timer I assume they are referring to is on the metrics screen, and it will be freezing because of block validation holding the `cs_main` lock, which the metrics screen updates also rely on

Hi @mineZcash , thanks for the prompt response. I'm using the zcash4win wallet user interface and giving 0.0001 for mining fees and 0.0001 for wallet development fees. Is there a minimum fee depending on the transaction amount? I'm only trying to send around £25 worth of ZEC.
ocminer 7:34 AM
Just to let you guys know there seems to be that at least one exchange, afaik HitBTC, which must be on a older wallet version and it's not registering some transfers/payments. I have fully confirmed payments on my side (several different wallets report the TX as confirmed) but they don't show up on HitBTC
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:34 AM
That should work fine, the default fee is set at .0001, are you sure the node is fully synced? @steve29
Thanks for the info @ocminer , I hope they aren't sticking with 1.09 which has just been depreciated
ocminer 7:36 AM
might be the reason

brandon 11:00 AM
ok thank you guys for chiming in.
My main concern was the FUD would scare new and not super educated investors and users away
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:00 AM
And 2. It often leads to a flame war in which there is no "winner" and just alot of back and forth, such is the internet. Everyone has an "equal voice" regardless of what they actually know about the subject
brandon 11:00 AM
simply because they dont really understand the tech
also the talk of inflation on ZCash and the inability to peer into the true market cap
is one ive yet been able to respond to with a educated and technically accurate response
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:03 AM
True market investors are not usually the ones that are looking for sound investment advice on Reddit / Twitter
The math is complex, and not easily explained so perhaps that puts some people off, but hopefully there is enough information out there that they know where to look for answers
brandon 11:06 AM
@mineZcash that is not entirely true.I had read up on zcoin long time ago and I found zcash on twitter a over a year ago.
this drove my interest in the project
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:10 AM
I do agree with you, many people first learn about projects on various social media, but it sounded like your concern would be about the big "whale" investors being turned away from Zcash by some FUD that they saw, which I don't really think is a big issue.
brandon 11:14 AM
naw I dont think a whale would but a lot of dolphins might
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:19 AM
Well the best we can do is to inform anyone who asks with accurate information, and point them to reliable resources. Save the dolphins 🐬🙂

Hey. I'm interested in developing a venture in the (not near) future with Zcash. I know a admittedly small amount about the tech..Although I think the premise is amazing. My question is..What's the EASIEST way to obtain some Zcash? Thanks in advance!!
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:05 PM
@glympsy the simplest way to get Zcash now is to buy some Bitcoin and trade it for Zcash
glympsy 1:06 PM
Thanks. I've got no idea how to do that..What's the best way/provider etc?
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:08 PM
Well, there are a couple steps you could go through, some sites like coinbase that will let you purchase Bitcoin with a Credit Card
Then once you have the Bitcoin you can trade it for Zcash on an exchange like Bittrex. Or use an App like Shapeshift to convert the BTC to ZEC
Or if you want to have a Person to Person transaction you could find someone nearby on localbitcoins.com
glympsy 1:13 PM
Great..Thanks. Should I have any concerns about my privacy and security completing this local bitcoins transaction? I'm not looking to make an investment here..But I obviously don't want it to cosy me the eat either!!
Cost
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:16 PM
You need to read reviews of people, and be careful of course, you never know who you will meet.
glympsy 1:16 PM
I'd probably feel safer through coin base..
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:17 PM
Keep in mind, Bitcoin is not Private in any way, neither is Localbitcoins, any service you sign up for will know information about you
There are several places online that will let you buy Bitcoin, just be sure to look at the fees. Some are much higher than others. And I don't recommend those Bitcoin ATMs, they usually have very high fees
glympsy 1:19 PM
Thanks a lot for your help.

Hey guys. I am interested in buying Zcash using my debt card on an app. I'm in United States. What's the best app to do this with?

I just signed up for coin base but they don't offer z cash.
Should I just buy Bitcoin on coin base and then trade t for z cash on another platform?
Thortorrens 2:47 PM
Also I don't have enough for Bitcoin can I buy litecoin and use that to trade
Thortorrens 2:59 PM
Anyone? Bueller ?
gareth 3:26 PM
You'll have to get some Bitcoin - you can buy fractions you don't need to buy a whole one. You'll then need to trade that Bitcoin for ZEC on an exchange such as Bittrex. You can then withdraw to a t-address from the exchange and should you wish then send it to a z-address you control (say if you are running https://zcash4win.com/)

Hey, @mineZcash Thanks for the support! I spent a lot of time analysing Zcash. You're doing a fantastic job, my only concerns (from an investor perspective) are:
- Dilution: the early community/ company is stacking vs investing. Lot of investors that do not seems willing to invest for further development
- Communication: That I can understand at your stage, but Monero took a clear lead, it can be explained by a lack of communication.
- Investment strategy: Lovely Vision but hard to understand where are you heading to (middle term)
Hope that it can help you and as I said, thanks for the fantastic job!!

How can zk-SNARKS private swaps work? Ie, User1 wants to trade X of crypto Asset1 for y of Asset2, and should be matched with User2 that wants to make this swap. How can this be done without others on the blockchain seeing who is trading what and for how much? How can User2 even find out about User1's offer? Does this work only if the users already decided to make a swap between themselves? Still, how does it work in that case?

why is this chat site used over #slack? just curious?
@daira got details on the "private trade" test that zcash successfully made on ethereum, iirc? I can't find the article now
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 6:22 AM
@mylord the Rocket Chat is used because Slack is prohibitively expensive for as many users as we have, if you need history to be retained
The Rocket Chat is also run independently of the Zcash Company
I'm not sure which private trade you're referring to; @arcalinea might know
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:38 AM
@daira is correct, @mylord Slack is not really designed to be an "open-door" chat with 3k members. They charge $6 _per member_ - _per month_ for an Enterprise plan. That's why you see alot of work arounds for auto-generated invites, it is supposed to be a approve-every-member system because they expect you to pay for it.

https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=evJeuqKY2kJQXLnH6 I suspect it's also possible to have unlinkable locks on different blockchains for atomic trades, but I think there are still details to work out. With hash-locked atomic trades, by observing the same preimage appearing in two blockchains, it's possible to tell they are associated. With unlinkable locks it's not possible to make that association.
daira October 16, 2017 1:29 AM
@mylord Completely private swaps will be easier when we have support for multiple token types (https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/830).

dstarcev 12:46 PM
I would try to double spend it with a larger fee, but zcash4mac doesn't allow this
nathan Electric Coin Company 12:49 PM
Ok, that transaction has 354 inputs. I believe many miners are rejecting transactions with more than something like 40 inputs, due to a performance problem with older node versions. 😞
dstarcev 12:51 PM
Where do you see it has so many inputs?
nathan Electric Coin Company 12:52 PM
I have a monitoring node with `txindex=1` in the config file (this ensures it tracks all transactions). Then I ran `zcash-cli getrawtransaction 'abbe…d78f' 1` and counted the number of entries in the `"vin"` JSON field.

They may cancel the operation if it lasts too long
nathan Electric Coin Company 1:00 PM
The exchange cannot cancel the transaction itself.
dstarcev 1:01 PM
And if the transaction is confirmed after a month they will just get my coins
I mean the can close the exchange order
nathan Electric Coin Company 1:02 PM
Ah. Well, if that happens I would demand the coins be sent back or your account deposited. If it's a reputable exchange I can't see that they would just take your coins.
So one brainstorm for a way to recover faster would be to generate a new transaction that double spends only one of those inputs.
The theory is that this new transaction would be small, and therefore could be mined quickly.
Once it is mined, it would make the large transaction invalid.
-at that point, the large transaction would get removed from all nodes.
In order for this to work, the new small transaction would need to reach the miner nodes. This might be tricky because other nodes still see the big transaction and will reject the small new transaction because of that.
And, I'm not actually too sure how to generate the new small double-spending transaction. I'll look into that.
dstarcev 1:05 PM
I will explain the issue to the support team of the exchange
nathan Electric Coin Company 1:06 PM
Yes, that's a good first step.
dstarcev 1:32 PM
So we decided that they don't proceed the exchange operation but return my coins back when (and if) the transaction is confirmed. So that I may not worry about the exchange rates

hello everyone!
I have some issue with zcash mac wallet which crashes (not opens), I have wallet.dat with z-address with funds and I simply don't know which parts of the wallet to backup so that I don't loose funds. At the moment, I backup everything, it is approx. 10GB of data, and after some crash this backups saved my ass.
Normally, a wallet.dat file kept in a few safe places should do the job (as with other callets), but with zcash I don't know if it is enough. The zcash app seems different, it searches for some proving key and those are stored in other folders in the system.
thanx, @radix42
are transactions when I put funds in z-address shielded or that is totally different?
Also, the wallet is crashed again, simply does not open. Perhaps you could help me with which parts of the folder system can be kept and which should be replaced from some backup: Blocks and Chainstate folders keep the updated blocks, is it enough to keep these fresh and replace all others (with the exception, of course of wallet.dat file)?

What's zcash role in Byzantium Ethereum update? How can 2 ERC20 tokens trade on Byzantium now? Is it indirectly via ZCash first?

How do that work, and stay private?
cryptodroid 1:58 PM
@radix42 Thank you. Now it opened (it is in /Applications but there was a copy on an other HD and Spotlight seemingly finds that one...
)
@radix42 So, if my funds in wallet.dat were received from a z-address from another wallet and are now in a z-address in this one, was it a shielded transaction, right? Do I have to keep the sprout-verifying.key and sprout-proiving.key files also properly backed up (one of them is 910MB) so that my wallet.dat is fully functional? Or I can move the .dat file to any other zcash wallet on an other to manage my funds?
huh... great! thank you again. Sorry for such questions, but I really want to understand and properly keep zcash, but these things I can't sort out myself and did not find proper detailed reading sources for it yet 🙂

eli.ben.sasson May 19, 2017 8:28 AM
@daira, I summarized the main advantages of STARK over SNARK, as already pointed out in my video talks: more scalable prover (currently \~10X faster), leaner crypto assumptions (Fiat Shamir), post-quantum security, no trusted setup. Main disadvantage is proof size (currently \~2000X longer, or ~ 600KB; as @arielg noted it could go down, say, to 100K for ZCash statements, this is an optimistic guess, not something we've actually done yet). I also repeated that even if it's not reasonable to use STARKs for single tx's, due to their size, their scalability should be useful if/when used to aggregate many many tx's. But the very first thing that needs to be done is to get the paper published and peer reviewed, which will take some more time.
and you can read the most up-to-date paper here https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash-wizards?msg=mLyQBQ8SZo7GWm66m

I had a technical question if that's possible. For shielded transactions, how is the information for a note transmitted to the receiver? From the spec, it looks like the information is encrypted using Pub/Priv key encryption, with a newly generated public and private key by the sender, and that only the sender generated pub key and the encrypted information is sent over the wire. How does a receiver know which piece of information to decrypt? Do they attempt to decrypt every single transaction in hopes of finding a successful one?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:08 PM
@muffin that's correct
For every z-address in your wallet, for every JoinSplit in every transaction in every block in the chain, you do a trial-decryption. If it succeeds, you know it is a Note sent to that z-address.
muffin 8:11 PM
That makes sense. I can't think of any other way without specifying a delivery recipient in some manner, which would lessen security.
[OFTC/stapler] @rocket.cat Bot 8:31 PM
hey
muffin 8:32 PM
I had one more question, if I may. Again for shielded transactions, how does a node know which note to verify with a given proof string? From what I can gather, the zero-knowledge proof system allows for a verification to take place (that a note can be spent/transferred) without leaking information about the note's public key, private key, nullifier, but I would imagine the ZK system would also need to take in a specific note as an input. It also seems as if there's a Merkle tree with the note commitments/trapdoors stored in them. Could you go into a little bit more information on how this works? Thanks for your time.

I sent 10.5 ZEC from zcash4mac to kraken wallet couple of days ago. 861e16022f060dff36508ae3eb9cc42c75349a51836f8a540967d99e1434ee8d. Though, it is being confirming, there's no such transaction listed in zchain explorer (though, it is seen in insight). restarting my wallet.dat file updates available balance, but it's impossible to send ZEC again. In zcash4mac I'm unable to change mining fee. Is there a problem with that?

How do I finish the transaction or get ZEC back?
I see similar problems above 🙂 no solutions yet, right?

Do you just want a lite wallet for transparent transactions? Or do you want to use Private Transactions? @beachboy
artemso 8:22 AM
@mineZcash thanks for the info.
So as I understand it is better to increase the size of mining payouts( decrease their quantity), so that input value would be lower?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:36 AM
Yes, it would be better to set your payout threshold for once a day, or once every other day. That would prevent lots of small transactions that have to be swept together to make one big one @artemso
beachboy 8:38 AM
what would you reccomend for private and what would you suggest for public? @mineZcash

If you want to use private+public transactions you can use Kozyilmaz or Zcash4mac, both are Mac full nodes.

Hi! I had a question about shielded transactions. Why are they not enabled by default?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 11:26 PM
@alex.hu they are!
Users can use whatever transactions they want by default, nothing is disabled
More specifically, the type of transaction a user uses depends on the address they choose to use. If they choose to use a t-address, they are using transparent transactions. If they choose to use a z-address, they are using shielded transactions.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:37 PM

Viewing keys are implemented in the consensus protocol, but there isn't much support for them yet in the RPC API or wallets
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:28 AM
An observer can determine that your publicly-known t-address is sending to a z-address, and can know an upper limit on how much ZEC is being sent, but nothing else (above the minimum data that a shielded transaction itself doesn't hide)

Andrei-1.... Understood... I'm on a PC and found it through a google search... Wow... not the best start for this crypto currency and exchange wallet... 🙂

If it's from an exchange or service you may need to contact thier customer service representative
ray.faulkenberry 1:18 PM
I'm wondering if there is any way to check... I have the transaction ID from Changelly... is that what you mean minezcash? I'm not sure about a tax id... that's new to me... 🙂
They said it went through... it has just not loaded up on my pc yet... the wallet I mean... Thanks for the response though.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:22 PM
Which wallet are you using on your PC?
Tx = transaction ID
ray.faulkenberry 1:25 PM
zcash4win I found it on a google search for using a pc... it was at the top... Lol. My son was helping me but is off to his college class at the moment... He may be back in a couple of hours... Nervous as the zcash4win is still trying to load... Hours now...
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:25 PM
If you look up your address on the explorer are the funds there?
Zcash4win has to be fully synced to get the latest transactions
andrei-1 1:26 PM
@mineZcash thanks but when I try that it give me an 404 error
ray.faulkenberry 1:26 PM
I have the ID and when I went to search it on the link provided above it says no record found... Fully synced? Should it take hours? Lol...
I'll have my son jump on as although I downloaded the wallet, he worked the transaction with changelly. They confirmed the funds/currency was sent from their end. We just don't see it anywhere and zcash is still loading... so very, very...50 more very's slowly. Lol

I want find topitc (if In English it's good) about how woking zcash "net", who mined block avery 2.5 minutes, who setup own solo server (linux is not problem for me), how is many diffirent client mining in pool & solo - but network zcash undestend total speed (difficult)
who = how
i want undestand who work in academical purposes
topitc = topics
andrei-1 1:42 PM
you want to create your own virtual coin?
ray.faulkenberry 1:46 PM
minezcash... do you have an email contact for zcash4win? Thanks for your help...
SVA 1:49 PM
no, i don't want to create own coins, i want understand how workin zcash (how working blockcain)
i don't understand how different clients (system without main server) woking how the one system, how doing mining process
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:54 PM
@ray.faulkenberry @radix42 is the developer of zcash4win. Your best bet is to let it run and complete the sync process. Don't forget that it's downloading and verifying the entire Blockchain, which is about 7GB of data
ray.faulkenberry 1:54 PM
Thanks Mine! I appreciate the help...
I'll continue to let it run...
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:57 PM
@SVA are you talking about Blockchain in general or specifically Zcash?
There is information about Zcash for Developers on https://www.zcashcommunity.com/developers/

    www.zcashcommunity.com
    Zcash Developers - Zcash Community

SVA 2:01 PM
team of Zcash have Russian speaking people? Google Translate is not good idea. Main - i want undestend how work Zcash, but Blockchain is core of any cpyptocoins, different is in hash functions & other things. Is it right?
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:03 PM
Sorry I don't know of anyone on the Zcash team that speaks Russian 🙁
But yes, there are key differences in mining Zcash vs other coins. Zcash uses Equihash algorithm for Proof of Work
SVA 2:05 PM
ok. it's easier for me to learn English

What's the issue @barrett092 ?
barrett092 9:36 AM
so i'm trying to set up zcash for the first time, I had to blow away my .zcash folder because a bunch of errors so I recreated it
but now all that is in there is my .conf file
and no wallet.dat
or anything else
yet the zcashd server is running
and I was able to generate addresses
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:39 AM
What caused you to delete the folder? How can it be running if not configured? What OS?
Linux I assume?
barrett092 9:45 AM
yes ubuntu
I was having issues connecting to the http server
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:45 AM
Is it connected now?
barrett092 9:45 AM
yeah, its validating transacations and everything but
no wallet.dat
I added gen=1 to the .conf file
to enable mining
but it still gives me that message
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:46 AM
So you are solo Mining with CPU, what message?
barrett092 9:47 AM
that i'm not currently mining
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:47 AM
Has it fully synced yet? It won't start until it is synced
barrett092 9:47 AM
how would I know that
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:48 AM
Blockheight on display screen
barrett092 9:48 AM
um
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:49 AM
Does it say 20xxxx something? Or 50%?
barrett092 9:49 AM
ohhh I see what you mean
'Downloading blocks'
its at 16%
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:49 AM
Then it's not fully synced to the chain yet
barrett092 9:50 AM
sorry I'm a n00b when it comes to mining and cryptocurrency in general
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:50 AM
But also, if you want to have a chance to earn a little Zcash you will need to connect to a pool
barrett092 9:50 AM
I've got two 1080ti's that i'm looking to mine with once everything is working
using nheqminer
(i think thats the name)
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:51 AM
That will work, the basic Zcashd miner is CPU only, and can't connect to a Pool.
You can run NEHQ independent of Zcashd
barrett092 9:52 AM
I'm still worried about those missing conf files though
and wallet.dat
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:52 AM
They are not dependant on one another
barrett092 9:52 AM
oh thats good
but don't I have to point the miner to a wallet?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:53 AM
Once you generate a address, you can point the miner to it
Are you sure the wallet.dat is missing? Did you delete it?
barrett092 9:54 AM
yeah I deleted the entire .zcash folder
and then recreated it
with zcash.conf
z or t address?
cause I do have those
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:56 AM
The wallet.dat isn't in the .zcash folder
Just your config file
Pools payout to t-addresses for now
barrett092 9:57 AM
hmm
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:58 AM
There is the Zcash folder, and the .zcash folder, they're different
barrett092 9:59 AM
I did a 'find' on the entire directory for wallet.dat and no luck
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:59 AM
I don't know what all you deleted and kept, when did you generate the addresses? Before or after you deleted stuff?
barrett092 9:59 AM
after
t1PJ5z1wFt38AjxPnEFeYurSb5278kpoCwB
my t address
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:02 AM
I would uninstall everything, re-download and re-compile. If you have blown away your wallet.dat you will not be able to spend any zcash sent to that address
barrett092 10:02 AM
ok
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:03 AM
I'm not at a PC right now to check which folder the wallet is in @bitcartel would you know off the top of your head?
barrett092 10:03 AM
i'll start over
thanks btw for helping
mining zcash with two 1080ti's - worth it? I don't really know what to expect for a return
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:08 AM
No prob, sometimes it's better to start clean
You can calculate profitability at https://whattomine.com

    whattomine.com
    WhatToMine - Crypto coins mining profit calculator compared to Ethereum
    Using WhatToMine you can check, how profitable it is to mine selected altcoins in comparison to ethereum or bitcoin

barrett092 10:14 AM
haha oh man, now i'm getting an authorization failed after the re-install
incorrect rpcuser or rpcpassword
I deleted the entire directory but I think the zcash was still running when I deleted it
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:19 AM
Do have Windows or Mac? It may be simpler for you to run one if the ports which have a GUI
barrett092 10:21 AM
its a special rig that only runs ubuntu, its primary purpose is for password cracking but we figured to use it to mine as well
I rebooted the computer
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:22 AM
Well the good news is you don't have to have Zcashd running on that rig to mine. Just install Zcash on another computer and run NEHQ on that machine.
barrett092 10:23 AM
ohhhh
that is true

barrett092 10:32 AM
i'm going to use an exchange
any recommendations?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:44 AM
I have used Bittrex and Poloniex, but others are good too. Just remember if you use an exchange, the exchange controls your private keys. If something happens to your account, or the exchange is hacked your funds will be lost.
I keep my ZEC in a local Zcash wallet so I control the keys. Only sending what I want to trade to an exchange.

barrett092 5:42 PM
hey mine
I finally got up and running
getting up 425 sol/s
reading more and more that with only 2 1080ti's I shouldn't go solo
and hsould join a pool
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:44 PM
Yeah, solo you won't have a chance, the difficulty is too high
barrett092 5:45 PM
any recos?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:45 PM
Join a pool, I like Suprnova and Slush, if you can avoid Flypool because they have too much hash
barrett092 5:45 PM
ok
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:47 PM
Not that there is anything wrong with Flypool, it's just not healthy for one pool to have so much of the network hashrate.
barrett092 5:50 PM
hmm
now to find out how to sync my machine to my worker

Hey I was about to buy some zcash and I found this "the auto-senescence feature in zcashd will trigger deprecation of all 1.0.10-1 nodes at block 209812 which should be in about 4 days. This means that nodes running 1.0.10-1 past that block will auto shut down unless started with the -disabledeprecation=1.0.10-1 flag. " I don¡t get it, what should I do? what does it mean? Thank you!
by the way I was going to buy it from Kraken

What do you mean?
Jaxx cannot scan QR codes that someone texted to the phone running Jaxx.
So my point is we have a long way to go in taking the easy, obvious thing that people try and making it Just Work. 😑
Isn't Patreon way better than a lot of things because our is monthly recurring?
I like the idea of a "pay so-and-so $X Zcash once per month" feature.

Hi @wallyrun , with Zcash you have a choice between Private and Public Transactions. https://z.cash/blog/anatomy-of-zcash.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Anatomy of A Zcash Transaction

they both operate in a similar manner when sending and receiving transactions but with a Private transaction only you and the other party know that a transaction has been sent
[OFTC/lwinch2006[m]] @rocket.cat Bot 6:17 AM
Can I ask one question? Is there any light wallet for zcash that supports private (z-) addresses, or it is just wallets with full node support them?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:17 AM
As opposed to most crypo-currency like Bitcoin where every transaction is recorded on a public ledger that anyone can see
For now there are no lite wallets that support private transactions, the next major release (Sapling) will reduce the amount of RAM and Time required
Which will allow for lite wallets to be used with private transactions

john.bruhling 11:34 AM
Mathematically yes, imagine dropping something to the floor once a second for a goggolplex years, eventually it will fly into the ceiling, eventually
Also the probability if it flying up into the ceiling between start and a goggol years is almost zero so yea dont solo mine, even cloud mining uses pools
tromer Zcash Foundation 12:06 PM
For very low hash rate, yes. But If the expectation value of your pool payments is much larger than the block reward of 10 ZEC, then solo-mining (at the same rate over the same period) is likely to yield a similar income.

    👍 1 

(If we ignore the tricks and good network links that pool operators have.)

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:53 PM
And Ethereum has taken a small step to incorporating zkSNARKS in contracts with the latest release, but
Ethereums zkSNARKs are implemented as computational primitives inside the Ethereum VM, sort of like function calls, intended for use by smart contracts. They are not implemented as part of a basic transaction format. Consequently, the gas cost for implementing and using a zkSNARK cryptocurrency smart contract system on top of Ethereum is large.
mylord 6:57 PM
How much smaller could gas costs be if Ethereum implemented zkSNARKs primitives as part of a basic transaction format? What would be the downsides/complexities of implementing them in that way? Is there a plan to do that? When?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:02 PM
You would have to ask Ethereum if they plan to incorporate them that way, but from what I understand it would not be possible for it to scale to all transactions. Have a read through this thread on Reddit, lots of good info from the Ethereum Developers and Community

Hey guys quick question. Apologies is this is super stupid but I'm new to equihash. My power is $.03/KWh CAD (so essentially free). I have the ability to snag GTX 1050s for $80 a pop. I have plenty of motherboards and risers to put them on. Equihash DAG remains constant, correct? I wouldn't have issue with the cards being 2gb right?
$80 Canadian so like $60 US. The ROI would be solid even if the resale value on them sucks.

hello is there a tutorial or walkthorugh or some steps to follow for forking zcash for a new altcoin.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:11 AM
That process is the same as for any Bitcoin-based cryptocurrency. The main thing is to make sure you pick new values for all the magic constants
(and while doing so, I'd recommend tweaking a few things to make things easier)
Depends what your goals are though
duffann 3:13 AM
of course I don't want a step by step guide but for example is there any list or stg that lists where to find those constants ?
I am a programmer myself but not experienced in crypto currencies , would like to learn how to fork zcash as I like zcash platofrm to create a new altcoin aybe in the future.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:14 AM
I should say, don't consider creating an altcoin lightly. It's a lot of work to both set up and then maintain.
duffann 3:17 AM
If we don't start somewhere thinking it is a lot of work , how can we learn anything 🙂
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:20 AM

aleksey 12:03 AM
Когда у вас была произведена процедура обновления количество zec в ордерах на poloniex составляла 10500 (это на сентябрь), сейчас 16700 (ноябрь) и думаю эта цифра будет расти все больше и больше, а прошло каких кто 60 дней, прирост на 6200. Данное количество с большей вероятностью сброшено вами (разработчиками), без труда видно, что с такой прогрессией zec станет банкротом, через пол года. Может кто ответить по данному вопросу что либо? Почему вы опускаете планку сложности?

When you have made the procedure for updating the amount of zec in orders for poloniex was 10,500 (this is for September), now 16700 (November) and I think this figure will grow more and more, and the past is about 60 days, an increase of 6200. This number is from more likely to be dropped by you (the developers), it's easy to see that with such a progression zec will become bankrupt, in half a year. Can anyone answer on this question anything? Why do you omit the bar of complexity?

How likely is it that Zcash can be used within the Ethereum platform? The last I heard, there were some talks about Baby ZoE almost a year ago.

I was thinking how the Ethereum ecosystem is growing fast and if Zcash could be the primary currency, it could be a huge use case for Zcash besides simply "private internet money".

Vitalik said so himself that ETH isn't meant to be a currency. That leaves Zcash as a wonderful candidate as the currency inside Ethereum! Less bloated transparent transactions for everyday activities and shielded transactions for private transactions. zK-snarks on Ethereum are apparently costly so transacting in Zcash could solve that problem. If there is a way to interact with both blockchains, that would bloat the Ethereum blockchain less and shift over the actual transacting onto the Zcash blockchain.

Of course, Sapling will play a huge role in this.

This summer has shown that Ethereum has the first mover advantage for a smart contracts platform and has massive support by companies and ICO's. I think that the immediate future of blockchain is shifting to Ethereum as it is the first to actually show consistent progress and rapid development.

As private internet money, usage and adoption is very important and I think that a large emphasis on actually being used and where it can be used is just as important as developing while the crypto space is small. Most of the coins in the past that wanted to be internet money simply died out because no one used them. With Zcash being a currency, it needs to start looking for places to integrate into to ensure it has the First Mover Advantage as Bitcoin 2.0
kozyilmaz 2:00 AM
How about smart contracts on Zcash (Hawk)?
w00pie 2:09 AM
I don't really see the purpose of reinventing the wheel that Ethereum already has going. The idea I proposed was so that instead of having smart contracts on Zcash, integrate Zcash into a platform dedicated to smart contracts.

That way Zcash can focus mainly on transfer of value and improving privacy/speed/bloat/etc. while the smart contracts platform (Ethereum) would focus on smart contracts and security.

Having Zcash try to implement smart contracts would be a massive headache that is not needed.

@w00pie: these are very good questions! I've been thinking about them a lot myself, and a lot of people have been bringing them up to me.
My current thought is twofold:
1. Within a few months, ZoE-style DApps are going to appear on Ethereum.
I'm surprised, in fact, that nobody has done their own ICO already to make such a thing.
If anybody reading this never thought of that but wants to do it, you're welcome. ☺
2. I haven't yet figured out what I think about some of the "big picture" ideas. Are smart contracts a good idea? Are they used only for ICOs? Are ICOs a good idea? I really don't know what to think about all that. I don't see strong "market proof" one way or the other.
BUT,
2. b. I'm sure that smoother interop between Zcash blockchain and Ethereum blockchain is a _good_ idea!
So I'd like to encourage people who care about this to help with BTCRelay/ZRelay.

@zooko Thank you for your response!
@radix42 The Ethereum ecosystem is the first time in crypto that something besides a store of value went mainstream on such a scale.

Ethereum is pretty much here to stay despite some small hiccups in the space. Gotta crack a few eggs to make an omlette.

Why not work on Zcash vs Hush on Ethereum? Just curious.

w00pie 5:32 PM
Okay that is an interesting thought. So in essence, since there is a problem of a single chain handling everything, the future resides more on linking between chains to share the load.
I mean, what you are doing is great. I didn't see why Hush was the choice but I can see now
So this BTC relay for Zcash is a big priority right now for Zcash so that it can say "Hey, use me" and provide private transactions that interact with Bitcoin
Since that is a big problem for Bitcoin
Thats quite the responsibility you got there!
Thank you for all the work you have provided for the Zcash ecosystem!

Are you part of the Zcash team?

Gotcha. By the way, you explorer is awesome. I use it as the main Zcash explorer as it is easier to navigate over the other. *thumbs up*
Oh, not bashing z.chain. They did an excellent job. Just for my personal preference, insight is great.
The more that are available the better
I've been in crypto for about 3+ years so I think I am more used to the insight layout vs the z.chain one.
I think my biggest regret is not starting to learn ore programming during this time so create and contribute something like this. Never too late to start I suppose
I think for the first 2 years, I was simply obsessed with the price and eventually came to the point of wanting to do something with crypto lol
But yeah, I really do appreciate the talk. I'll have to catch yall later

Out of curiosity, ZClassic appears to mimic all of Zcash's qualities, while not shelling out a dev fee. My questions would be: Could the corporation behind Zcash not take some sort of legal action about this? 2: How could we trust that the founder of Zclassic not mint him/herself coins if there was no founding event like Zcash? I'm totally boggled by that currency's existance

@zen like Bitcoin, Zcash is open source and free for anyone to use: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/COPYING The math is quite complex so it is important that anyone who forks Zcash like, Zen, Zclassic, Hush, Komodo, etc.... knows what they are doing

Dear all
Im new in this, this is the first crypto-money that I'm mining, I use suprnova pool to mining it. Is that pool fine or someone recommend another one? After 3 days mining, about two hours ago, I pay-out the Zcash. The transactions was confirmed but when I get in my zwallet now we don't receive any. Could someone please explain me? Thanks in advance.

Is the wallet fully synced up to the network?
ningliu420 4:47 PM

And you created the address with that same wallet?
Do you have a txID to look up?

mineZcash Admin Owner 4:50 PM
You are only 23% synced
When you are 100% your payout will show
zen 4:50 PM
If you're new to crypto, might not be a bad idea to start with a software wallet. Otherwise you need to look into backing this wallet up... Not the end of the world but it's a learning curve
Cryptonator works well for me on Android.
ningliu420 4:51 PM
oh, thanks

I think you can convert between cryptos really easy with them too with fees.
A lot of Zcash miners will mine ZEC and convert to BTC using them
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:55 PM
I know people use Jaxx and Crypotonator too without issue.
ningliu420 4:55 PM
So, >zen you recommend use coinomi
zen 4:56 PM
I would but I'm just a nobody. @mineZcash probably knows his shit way better than me.
I've used Coinomi for years and never had issues. Basically no fees and they show your wallet value in USD which is nice

I don't think Zooko is gonna lynch you for mining stuff other than ZEC
Personally, I have a Xeon server that I mine Monero on and a bunch of RX 470s I mine ETH with. I use my Nvidia GPUs with Zcash. It'd be asinine to mine Zcash on AMD GPUs or CPUs. Always good to diversify anyways.

yes
suprnova...
i have only one and card
zen 5:04 PM
I've been experimenting and Flypool is consistently paying out more than Suprnova in my experience. People don't like Flypool b/c it's like half the entire network's hash rate, but they're solid. But I'm a small sample size
ningliu420 5:06 PM
Next time i will try with flypool
zen 5:06 PM
Yeah it's not a big deal. Suprnova is reputable too
Also no fees which is solid
ningliu420 5:07 PM
one more question, when i transfer my zcash from my desktop wallet to internet wallet. Can I delete the app?
zen 5:07 PM
Like the desktop client?
Yeah, as long as you don't have any ZEC kicking around in it, no loss in deleting it
Also, I think I have the Jesus 1080ti. 760 Sol/s 70% PT. 2025Mhz core... Stable for 2 days

Final thing. This is solely my opinion and I assume most people will disagree with me here. You'd be far better off mining Ethereum until that goes POS in the next couple of months. 290xs are much better on ETHhash than Equihash coins.If you believe in Zcash you can convert ur ETH into ZEC. @ningliu420
Also, there will be plenty more Zcash minted over the coming years (not a bad thing but tough in terms of price appreciation) as it's following a BTC-like curve. Ethereum is near the end of its rapid growth in coins outstanding...
With that said, ZEC is objectively better cryptography IMHO
So make your bets how you will...

I've been thinking about trying to IPO some sort of investment fund on the TSX Venture, where we literally buy GPUs and mine Zcash and pay a dividend. Format it as a real estate investment trust. Like all the other blockchain stocks are a scam. The market would shit itself with a 100% ROI per year.
I live in a province with like super cheap power too.
It'd cost about $20 000 to get the legal shit together for it, like I'm super fucking tempted to do it. If it could raise a few million in IPO that could rent a space and buy a fuckton of GPUs.

Like here's my thought. People that invest in real estate in the stock market look for a ~5-10% cap rate. That's basically they buy a $100 000 property and get $5000-10000 in profit a year. GPUs mining ZEC have a ~130% cap rate after electricity costs (that's assume $200 ZEC at current difficulty). If I payed a 15% yield on the investment and reinvested the rest into GPUs to keep up with difficulty increases, that'd be an amazing return.
I'll keep y'all informed lol

mineZcash Admin Owner 11:25 AM
You still have the issues of ICO's being banned in several places, and the SEC treating ICOs as a security, so there's that.
But this chat is about Zcash, nice day in the markets today 😎
zen 11:37 AM
See, I'm just thinking of taking it to the stock market. Raise $ and invest it in mining hardware. It's not even a coin offering. Just a way to invest in a company mining. So it dodges the ICO rules
There's something called a capital pooling company you can register in Canda. You and a bunch of other investors pool money and invest in something

@niraj This is described in section 6.4.2 of the protocol spec: "The difficulty filter is unchanged from Bitcoin, and is calculated using SHA-256d on the whole block header (including solutionSize and solution). The result is interpreted as a 256-bit integer represented in little-endian byte order, which MUST be less than or equal to the target threshold given by ToTarget(nBits)."
niraj November 5, 2017 11:13 AM
can some one share input on calculating previous hash of a block to check whether it is a valid block or not ? I read its a SHA256d on the block ..does it mean on 143 byte + 1344 bytes = 1487 bytes in total..? what is the issue of little endian ?? can we calculate hash of hex in a block or need concatenate the multiple field values ??
need it for a parser to differentiate between valid and invalid block

Hey Radix!
gandhii 10:56 AM
so far I've found 3 different formatting variations from different places online for the z_sendmany command and none have worked. including a few variations I came up with myself.
It sure was easier to put money into this thing than get it out.
Question. Is this memo thing really optional? I am using z addresses, if that matters, doesn't sound like it should. But where do you get the hex data to put in this field if it required?
gandhii 11:43 AM
thank you for your help. I'm sending z to z
is there a legitimate command sample you can point me to? so I can verify if that is what I am doing wrong or not
Neither the one in man and the one in the 1.0 user guide are working for me. I'm hoping that my syntax is off in some manner that is not yet clear
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:49 AM
What is the syntax you are using?
`z_sendmany "zcBghahe" "[{\"amount\": 0.8, \"address\": \"zcBsudFgt\"}]"`
Replace the zaddress and the amount in that line and you should be good to go. Be sure to to include a 0 before the decimal if doing less than a whole ZEC

in truth I have been playing around with this for some time, we just announce it today along with some matching funds from bitcoin.com, read more at antiwar.me and we did do a pressr so maybe we will get some news about it.
thanks for the link, I will follow up with that, I was hoping some in here might take a look at the address we posted and help me understand why I might want to post a transparent address or possible if I should have a HD wallet rotate a fresh address like the other coins do. https://www.antiwar.com/cryptocurrencies/

thank you! Ill tweet that link in a bit. as a 501c3 we have always maintained that we DO NOT need to know who is donating to us but we also thought that posting a transparent address might be worth while because some want to know that we are in fact transparent.. not sure, I looked over the Wikileaks site as I was planning this and found it odd that they posted both addresses.
gandhii 12:13 PM
one more question.. since I am here.. is the fee being taken out of the value sent or what is left in the address?
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:14 PM
It's up to the doner if they are comfortable using transparent addresses, thats probably why WikiLeaks has both
The fee will be reduced from the amount sent.
gandhii 12:15 PM
thank you.
drew 12:18 PM
i see, it also occurred to me that some who don't use the client can't send funds privately and we should give people ever option to donate. donor privacy is very important to us but if people don't care about that this is fine too. In the past many people have not wanted to donate with a credit card for fear of being put on a list, its a known fact that our org is under the scrutiny of the crown.
mineZcash Admin Owner 12:22 PM
The Zcash Foundation is also a non-profit organization, being included on that list of organizations that accept Zcash is not a direct endorsement of any particular institution. I think @amiller would agree with that statement.
gandhii 12:23 PM
Just tested.. and my results were the opposite. I was moving the totality of one address into another. And put the total number in the amount field. It gave me an insufficient funds error. Worked fine when I sent less 0.001 and it zeroed out that address.
Thanks for the help. Have a nice weekend.

Hi!
I have a question: is it possible to receive anonymous payments from euro -> zcash with this coin? So people pay on my website with euro and I receive it in Zcash. The customer doesn't know my company or my name...
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:43 PM
@crivo there are a few services that will allow your site to receive Zcash
https://www.zcashcommunity.com/markets/

    www.zcashcommunity.com
    Zcash Markets - Zcash Community

Look under merchant services, unfortunately they only support Transparent Addresses at this point in time
crivo 4:44 PM
Mhh 🙂
Do you think there will be an option for non-transparant addresses?
So if I understand well: the merchant services ask your company name and personal name, but the buyer won't ever know who you are, correct?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:47 PM
I hope so, once Sapling is released next year. But you still have the issues of privacy leaking due to people seeing the IP address of the website, server, domain host, etc...
And the third party service knows things about both parties
crivo 4:51 PM
I saw that GoDaddy offers an option to buy a domain name with some privacy but I have no idea how "private" this would be
Btw do you have some more information about Sapling?

I don't like Suprnova or Nanopool so I'll have to figure something out
If anyone has a NA pool they like gimme a shout
Not like my 3k Sol/s is gonna put Flypool over the edge anyway haha
@mineZcash That sucks my dude. I'd let u mine where I live to ur wallet minus my power costs, but no way you'd ever trust me with that anyway xD. Gotta love $.06/KWh renewable energy haha
I like to tell people my mining is good for the environment, I'd be burning natural gas to heat my apartment if not for my GPUs using wind and hydropower. Not like all those 1070s I bought have a carbon footprint or anything haha.

flypool has the majority because it offers the best and fastest functionality
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 7:45 PM
1% fee, majority of shares etc
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 7:45 PM
other pools should offer 0.5% or 0% with more transparency
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 7:45 PM
supply and demand
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 7:45 PM
zen: tried slushpool for a bit but it's rates were variable
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 7:45 PM
zen: I literally make 2x on flypool that I did on slushpool
zen 8:08 PM
Yup Nanopools payouts always skimmed 10-20% of what i should be getting
As far as I've seen Flypool is the best
@arielg I know this is a super broad question, but if I wanted to get into aiding in blockchain development, where do I start, where do I go to learn?

Dwarfpool is huge
But I don't think they have NA servers

I figure I'll put it on water when Im done mining
I have a r9 290, that was a great generation from AMD
I mine ETC with it tho
Not ZEC
That card mined me like 4k in BTC back in the day lol
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:33 PM

can still do it
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:35 PM
like nicehash
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:35 PM
but not a rip off
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:35 PM
like actually make good BTC
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:35 PM
anyways who's mining to trade for fiat anyways ;p
zen 8:35 PM
Yeah, that's true. I always mined ETH and ZEC direct instead of more BTC, but in retrospect would've made more with Nicehash
Hindsight is 20/20 tho

Then my gaming desktop has a R7 1700 (65w) and a 1080ti- 220w
Those are estimations
I've been running 100% PT b/c I can use the heat rn
The CPUs are mining Monero
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:37 PM
isn't that wonderful haha
zen 8:38 PM
Yeah dude
Cheap power is a blessing
But check eBay during the week
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:38 PM
what's your kwh$?
zen 8:38 PM
$.08 Canadian ($.065 US)
Lots of RX cards for cheap with miners dumping them
I bought a lot of strix 570s for C $230 each
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
ya but those rx cards are essentially abused
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
lol
zen 8:39 PM
Yeah for sure
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
idk if the person ran it at 100% fan
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
or w/e
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
I prefer to buy new
zen 8:39 PM
But they still have warranty and prob aren't bricked lol
Actually
Depends on manufacturer
I bought a 1060 FTW with a blown cap on it on ebay for $80. Mailed it to EVGA and they gave me a new one xD
EVGA is awesome
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
idk dwarfpool looks better and better each time I scan it
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:39 PM
nice
zen 8:40 PM
Buying them used is chill cause they don't need receipt for warranty
But I'll check dwarfpool for sure
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:40 PM
you're probably right
[OFTC/dnj] @rocket.cat Bot 8:40 PM
tbh
zen 8:40 PM
It could be a long term issue for the community if flypool stays so big
I'll have to send a pic of my poor 290
A fan on it got fucked and strating hitting the shroud. I ghettorigged the shroud up with thermal pads so it doesn't scape
Looks like shit but it's still going
Pretty well 4 years full throttle

There’s no point in Developing a privacy-anonymous centric crypto when there’s no Cold storage wallet to store it? If the team at Ledger & Trezor cancome up with T-Adddresses surely the Claimed World Class scientists, Engineers & Developers from Zcash can callaborate in Developing a Wallet with Z-Addresses?

@FarSider that's a good question for #zcash-mining 🙂

I send from one wallet to another zchash and pass 10 days, money still not comming
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:01 AM
@max-1 (S) means the output has been spent
What this likely means is that the transaction you made is in the mempool (so the old outputs look spent), but the transaction hasn't been mined (so the new outputs aren't yet spendable)
mifeng 6:07 AM
@mineZcash YES，all right now,wait for a long time

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:16 AM
Yes, it is likely just waiting to be mined, how long ago did you send it @max-1 ?
max-1 6:16 AM
10 days ago
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:18 AM
Hm, that does seem strange. Was it one transaction with alot of small inputs?
max-1 6:19 AM
https://zcashnetwork.info/tx/f2addea4aeabaf875a285d97b79816539fb3d7600fb30e210d4feb5040f697a1
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:19 AM
Like mining payouts?
max-1 6:19 AM
9.27 - my
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:23 AM
Oh wow, that has over 800 inputs!
I can't say how long it will take to clear, but I suggest that you set your mining payouts to a higher level like 0.1 or 1.0 to avoid issues in the future
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:26 AM
Yeah, that is going to take a long time to mine, particularly as the mempool is currently filled with a large number of 500-input transactions, and there are only a few small mining pools mining many-input transactions
max-1 6:26 AM
Have some solution, may be pay to some mining pool to force this transaction?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:27 AM
Wait, hang on
The transaction you linked above *has* been mined
And wherever you sent it to has already spent that output
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:28 AM
Oh, yes it was mined on the 3rd
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:28 AM
(on-chain - looks like it was sent to an exchange?)
@max-1 were you sending 9.27 ZEC of mining payouts to an exchange?
max-1 6:31 AM
i send from cryptonator
wallet to exchange
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:32 AM
Okay, then it *has* been received by the exchange
If your balance there hasn't been updated, you should open a ticket with them, giving them the link to the transaction above.
max-1 6:32 AM
in exchange i see but see UNCONFIRMED
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:33 AM
Yep, that's an issue with the exchange
The transaction itself has nearly 7500 confirmations
max-1 6:34 AM
Ok, me need just create ticket in exhcange and done?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:35 AM
Yeah, give them the link above, and they should be able to go and check in their system that they did indeed receive the funds in their wallet

Good morning. Has the ledger for zcash storage changed since the days it was called zerocoin?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:08 AM
... yes? Depends what you are thinking of.
Sixophrenia 2:08 AM
There is a network that forked from zerocoin and I need to be able to scan that network for incoming transfers.
is leveldb the old way that zerocoin stored the blockchain/ledger?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:09 AM
I think you might be confusing a few different things
Sixophrenia 2:09 AM
very possible.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:09 AM
Zerocoin was the 2013 paper that used inefficient NIZK proofs
Zerocash was the follow-up paper based on zk-SNARKs
Zcash is a cryptocurrency based on the Zerocash paper
Sixophrenia 2:10 AM
maybe I can show you a picture, and that may help answer my question
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:10 AM
(but improved from it, fixing several issues in the paper)
Sixophrenia 2:10 AM
what I am attempting to do is very hacky.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:11 AM
Yeah, that would help. Because AFAICT there is no cryptocurrency called "zerocoin"
Sixophrenia 2:11 AM
File Uploaded: ledger.PNG
So I know there are things like the bitcoin blockchain scanner. and the ether scanner. and they allow someone to track what has happened on the blockchain. did Zerocoin (and this fork) have the same ability?
if that's the case, then what is "http://zerocoin.org"

    zerocoin.org
    Zerocoin Project

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:12 AM
That's the website for the original Zerocoin paper
Note how it refers to the later Zerocash paper, and to Zcash
Sixophrenia 2:13 AM
yes I understand. I do understand the upgrade. But I am working with soulcoin. and that's forked from the old.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:13 AM
Ah, there;s your misunderstanding
Sixophrenia 2:13 AM
i just need to know what stores the ledger
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:13 AM
Zcash has never implemented Zerocoin
And Soulcoin is not a fork of Zcash
Sixophrenia 2:13 AM
It's a fork of zerocoin.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:13 AM
There's a separate cryptocurrency Zcoin that chose to implement the Zerocoin paper; maybe that's what you're thinking of?
It's completely independent of Zcash; I have no idea what they did
Sixophrenia 2:14 AM
maybe that's who can help me get an answer. yes. I guess
ah. sweet, they have a discord. thank you
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:15 AM
But more generally: the leveldb database *is* where a representation of the blockchain is stored
Sixophrenia 2:15 AM

    >_> 

well that's all i need to know.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:15 AM
(that's a feature implemented by Bitcoin, inherited by all cryptocurrencies using its base)
however, that may not store the Zerocoin-specific stuff
You'd need to ask them about that
Sixophrenia 2:16 AM
I understand. I just need the ledger for an ICO
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:16 AM
It would store the transparent layer stuff
Sixophrenia 2:16 AM
i am already there asking.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:17 AM
Ah, your questions make more sense now 🙂
Sixophrenia 2:18 AM
Sorry. I am struggling to grasp all this blockchain stuff.
I'm just now finding out how useless soulcoin is.
The only good that could come from it is something that's temporary.

but yea. that's my journey . how i got here. thanks man. this has helped me understand a little more

Simple question - With the supposedly qualified & expertise team at Zcash, why can’t they develop a Wallet Cold Storage, Desktop & Mobile ? There’s so much scams in the Crypto space wouldnt it be more simpke , easy & cost efficient to develop they’re own? Can you imagine the Trust , confidence & boost in the Zcash ecosystem? From the outside looking in, Zcash has a negative reputation , it appears the same rhetoric is heard all the time without any action, I suppose that negativity is now reflected in its value- 17th Markrp Cap

    Hi Austin, I'm largely responsible for the fact that ZcashCo has not initiated a wallet development effort. Why? There are several reasons: First and most fundamental, opportunity costs: We've been busy at work on a few key things: first, a new protocol (codenamed Sapling) which will have incredible benefits, including for porting and adoption. Second, we've been spending our time helping multiple good existing wallets (and exchanges, and other products) integrate Zcash. Second, specia...

As far as marketcap goes, sites like coinmarketcap list _all_ coins equally, even Ponzi schemes and ICOs that barely have a product. Not to mention that Zcash only launched a year ago and only has about 2.6M coins in circulation. If you want to see a more accurate representation of the _future_ value of a coin I recommend a site like https://onchainfx.com that lets you sort by future (2050) coin supply and calls out the more "questionable" coins.

We realise Zcash main priority is privacy, however isn’t the fact that Development is so slow the real issue ? Why is the Team small ? With the level & amount Foundation has of Zcash over 4 years surely they could find & add more development staff? It’s like the analogy of an Ice-Cream maker selling Ice-Cream without giving you the tools to eat it- cone, spoon, cups....Zooko I remember few months back on Twitter saying the value of Zcash would reach $500 cause of Zcash Trust & I remember Nathan Wilcox tweeting we don’t Tweet about things unless it’s at the “Baked” stage , we’ll by now whatever your Baking must be either burnt & @mineZcash

[edit by @daira: see the moderation warning below] @mineZcash I can guarantee you @ Zooko Tweeted few months ago the price would reach $400-500 by October, I don’t have time to trace the Tweet however if you want proof I’m happy to find it & paste the link here, when thes types of Tweets or other messages are posted by Zcash Admin, there comes a time when Investors lose the trust & honesty as it appears it’s all “Talk “ false information with no action, the Foundation has had over 1 Month to process , analyse , communicate, offer the Grants yet we hear nothing about the grant recipients. I’m sure Zooko means well & is a great person but the “Perception “ in the Crypto space is many - Scam, Trustless, he seems to have the image of Trump in CryptoCurrency & that does not benefit anyone, maybe he should just hire a few more staff who can fast track the Development & take a back seat & focusing on the “Important “ aspects of the Zcash ecosystem with the Foundation & it’s Developers, cause at this rate if this continues then sooner or later there will be a new company-companies who will offer Investors & Consumers an alternative Tech more advanced than Zcash with a productive, efficient Management.

And for your information, in no shape or form am I attacking Zooko, I’m merely stating the facts,

mineZcash Admin Owner 6:44 AM
It's actually not a fact if it can't be substantiated with evidence. I understand that you have invested in Zcash and (like all of us) you want Zcash to succeed but claiming that Zooko has somehow "promised" that the price will reach _any_ certain amount is simply incorrect.
The development team is working hard, daily to make Zcash better. You can see the progress on Github or the #zcash-dev-bot channel here. Zcash is getting faster, using less memory, more secure all the time.
You may be used to following coins that have big marketing and PR efforts where they make big deals of the smallest announcements, but that has never been the approach of Zcash. There is a reason that the current release is called "Sprout" and the next release "Sapling"
They represent the growth and maturity of Zcash and it's ecosystem. Zcash is the first coin to ever use zkSNARKS, and they know that you only get one chance to get it right, else the Privacy of the entire system would be called into question.

And it is this approach, as well as the willingness to work with other development teams (like Ethereum) that improves the entire cryptocurrency space.

e.g. my CPU miner just got new work "1511013066" and my CPU miner just got new job "1511016843"
[OFTC/rapaul] @rocket.cat Bot 1:19 AM
that 2nd number was for the GPU not CPU
[OFTC/rapaul] @rocket.cat Bot 1:21 AM
ah, https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/12955/how-do-mining-pools-distribute-work-effectively answers my question, google FTW

    bitcoin.stackexchange.com
    How do mining pools distribute work effectively?
    What does the mining-pool architecture look like? Obviously GPU's can hash data much faster than it can be distributed via the internet, so I assume pools must allocate a range of nonces for miners...

Hi guys, whar happened with the 17.11.20 version update? I dont see any news or update about the zcash.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:28 AM
@mineZcash hmm, we should figure out how to collate compilation instructions
I've had Zcash compiling on CentOS 7 for a while now in CI, with dependencies and process "documented" in `contrib/ci-workers`, but that's not entirely user-friendly...
It would be awesome if we could have user-readable from-source compilation instructions, that were generated from the same config that `contrib/ci-workers` uses!
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:30 AM
I don't think it was widely known that it could be done, looks like she had a little trouble getting it to work
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:30 AM
(Or that both pulled from the same backend definition of "how to compile Zcash on OS foo")
Yeah
Wouldn't surprise me if the `ci-workers` script was only usable on the AWS AMI (that's the only place I've been using it)

Hello everyone, I am new to Zcash and would like to start mining with 1080 TI. I am trying to understand the hash rate as this is called Sol/s, what would my hash rate be for each 1080 TI ?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:22 PM
Hi @david-i-am! You should ask mining-related questions in #zcash-mining 🙂
But to answer your question, one Sol/s here is conceptually equivalent to one H/s elsewhere, but Sol/s numbers for Zcash are not comparable to H/s numbers for any other PoW algorithm

Hi str4d, thank you for your answer.

Should say in bottom right corner 100%
When you start it begins downloading the Blockchain, it can take several hours to sync up the first time

Hi all, quick couple questions. I'm playing with payment disclosure and trying to write a quick blog post walking through generating one - I've successfully done this after extracting the info from the debug.log and all works really well. I tried on an old transaction and get `Could not find payment disclosure info for the given joinsplit output` so presumably this doesn't work retroactively? Also what is the option `-txindex=1` I didn't have this set and had to reindex everything.

@gareth correct - payment disclosure doesn't work retroactively, as it requires caching data about a transaction that is otherwise ephemeral.

    👍 2 

`-txindex=1` causes your node to keep an index of all transactions in the blockchain, instead of only the ones in your wallet. @bitcartel could say why it is necessary; I'm personally hoping we can eliminate the need for it while this is still an experimental feature.

Is any strong engineer can solve puzzle of zcash?
I just get an error where using zcash-cli to send a transaction: bad txns coinbase spend has transparent output
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:06 AM
That means that you're trying to spend from part of a mining reward (i.e. an output of a coinbase transaction) to a transparent address
Coinbase outputs can only be spent to shielded addresses, with no change
You may find it easier to use the `z_shieldcoinbase` RPC call, which was added in v1.0.13 to make this simpler
bibodeng 7:11 AM
yes, I'am sending mining reward to an wallet address
OK, so i need to use z_shieldcoinbase RPC to generate a shielded address, and then send the coinbase reward to that address?

Has joined the channel.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 7:24 AM
Use `z_getnewaddress` (https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/doc/payment-api.md#addresses) to create the shielded address, and then `z_shieldcoinbase` to send the coinbase reward there

@daira Hello, I am trying to compile a project that makes use of the libzcash library ( built inside zcash )
Do you have any hints ? I can't get it to work
i have added includes and library as well as compilations flags to my proejct
but when i try to access libzsnark::
i get an error like: libsnark has not been declared
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:45 PM
The libzcash library isn't actually built as a library as such
It's that way from an older code organisation
roland.mc.fadden 1:49 PM
@str4d What would be the correct way to import zcash code base in order to be able to use the functions inside libsnark::?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:49 PM
If you want the libsnark functions, just use libsnark
It is its own library

*belonging
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:51 PM
Well, as long as the libsnark library and includes are in your build system correctly, it should work fine
But with C++, it entirely depends on how you are doing the building
(what build system you are using, how you are pulling in the code, etc.)
You may find it easiest to add a "libzcash" to the Zcash Makefiles containing what you want, build that, and then include it + libsnark (and the other dependencies) in your code
roland.mc.fadden 1:54 PM
I got libsnark integrated in my project and i am able to use the library, so using libzcash:: should work out of the box ? i am using cmake
i copied the x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu library with the lib and includes into my main project
Can't i just use libzcash.a as it is now ? i don't understand what you mean by "adding a libzcash to the Zcash Makefiles containing what i want"

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:08 PM
I haven't tried to use it that way, so I won't be much help sorry
It *should* be possible though. I mean, looking at the Makefile, libzcash.a should contain everything in `src/zcash`
We'd need to see build logs, errors etc. to be able to be more useful
(and you'll find more people around next week, after we are back from holiday)

@allen This one is covered in the FAQ on the website. 🙂 https://z.cash/support/faq.html#difference-between-zerocoin-zerocash-zcash-zec

"Zerocoin is a cryptographic currency protocol invented by Ian Miers, Christina Garman, Matthew Green, and Aviel D. Rubin in 2013.

Zerocash is an improved cryptographic currency protocol invented by Eli Ben-Sasson, Alessandro Chiesa, Christina Garman, Matthew Green, Ian Miers, Eran Tromer, and Madars Virza in 2014.

Zcash is an implementation of the Zerocash protocol, with certain improvements as described in our protocol specification (all of the scientists who designed the Zerocash protocol are members of the Zcash team)."

where i can find the zerocoin wallet？
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:34 AM
@allen coins other than Zcash should be discussed in #other-coins
Everyone: please bear in mind that just because a coin is called "zero" something or "z" something-related, doesn't mean that it has anything much (or at all) to do with Zcash or inherits its security properties
Recently there have been people trying to promote coins that are not even Zcash forks, just ERC-20 tokens, but with similar names attempting to take advantage of the reputation of Zcash
So, please apply a healthy degree of skepticism about seemingly Zcash-related altcoins
allen 5:43 AM
There are still official developers to maintain zero it?
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:46 AM
This is the first I've heard of "Zero". I know nothing about it other than that someone put up a website claiming it will be a new coin supposedly "born from Zcash". Anyone can do that; it doesn't mean anything

As far as I know "Zero" doesn't have anything to do with the Zerocoin protocol either
In general: two things that have similar names do not necessarily have anything in common other than similarity of names

i'm not totally clear on how longterm statistical disclosure attacks will work against the mixnet designs we are building... and it seems there is even less chance for it to work in the case of a mixnet transport for zcash transactions
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 10:10 AM
i suppose it's all about linking a given zcash transactions with a message that gets sent into the mixnetr
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 10:10 AM
and the set size can be reduced by noticing which mixnet users are online
[OFTC/dawuud] @rocket.cat Bot 10:12 AM
although there is no "session" or way to link multiple transactions together as having come from the same user... none that i can think of anyway

And i heard that
ZCash private transactions are all possible to decrypt
with private keys used when starting chain
NealJayu 2:17 PM
@Mdk3322 Thanks for asking. That's actually a popular misconception about the Zcash setup ceremony:

    > If the Trusted Setup were somehow compromised the attacker would theoretically be able to forge coins but the privacy of all Zcash users transactions would still remain intact. There is no evidence whatsoever that the first Trusted setup was compromised. And since we are on the subject; I know the Trusted Setup has been a big source of distrust among Zcash detractors despite an elaborate ceremony which had reporters, videos, and many first hand accounts. So I have good news for those who don’t “trust” the “trusted” setup; the next major upgrade to Zcash will involve a new Multi-Party Computation (AKA Trusted Setup) with a randomness accumulator that will allow it to scale as large as hundreds or even thousands of individuals.

@zooko Hypothetical scenario, asking you because i think you might know something about it, although anyone else should feel free to chime in. Lets say im or there is a CEO of a promising ICO in that, like zcash, it is designed to satisfy the moral imperative of a kind of universal accessibility, for whats not important. Lets say members of the community are wondering why we dont have a marketing campaign. I say because functionality and accessibility are my teams job and not bolstering the price. It becomes deceptive and works to undermine the moral foundation of the company and its vision (we'll say is at least as good as zcash). What would you say to said CEO if you knew them were trying to support them in that stance? Or since it is relatively pertinent, what are some things people have said to you to support your stance on the matter?
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:37 PM
Hm. I'm a little confused about if you're "asking for a friend", i.e it is actually you, or it is actually me, or it is actually someone else. 🙂

    👍 1 

Anyway, there's no simple answer. I agree with you that short-term promotion of the price of the token is a bad idea — prone to conflicts of interest, etc. — but I disagree with the idea that marketing is only for that purpose.
Instead I think marketing is essential for the larger and better purposes such as universal accessibility.

I've been spending a lot of time reading up on the underlying technology behind Zcash. To better understand the technology, I am trying to play around with the underlying technology a bit. There were a few things I am trying to find out. For example, I want to see if it’s possible to create a proof that the amount of a secret transaction is amount X. Theroetically if I have the private key to the senders address I should be able to create such a proof, right?

@mu.k.paw if you want to convert Zcash to fiat, the easiest way is to trade it for BTC, then sell the BTC. You also might be able to use an exchange like Kraken
Or you could find someone to do a P2P trade with you
@aubie I'm not sure what you mean by "Zcash chain could be over taken by Zclassic chain"? Zclassic is a fork of Zcash and has a separate network.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:04 AM
@aubie: a Zclassic block would not be valid on the Zcash chain or vice versa. The only issue with the network magics being the same is a minor quality-of-error-reporting issue for a node that accidentally connects to the wrong network
So you were told incorrectly about the potential for any disruption to either chain

@jude not as far as I know, the Keypool has 100 transparent addresses by default when you start, but you can always refill the keypool if it runs out. You do have to generate a new z-address manually each time you want one, there is no keypool for z-addresses. And I don't see how there would be a limitation on # of z-addresses either.
@paky make sure your node is fully synced 100%

Hello guys. I got a question: What is the advantages and disadvantages of Zcash protocol in comparing to DASH? Are they both 100% anonimous
ledgerwatch 4:35 AM
@31337 the more correct is to say that they are not "anonymous", but "privacy preserving". When you use DASH's private send, you mix your coins with anybody who is currently doing private send in the same block, which could be a very small pool. You can wait longer to trade off time for privacy, but it is hard to predict how much privacy you are getting. Things are a bit more advanced in Monero, where you just pick 10 outputs yourself and mix with them (without them having to do anything). In ZCash, you are effectively mixing with all the coins that have ever been poured into shielded outputs, which is a pool that is constantly growing. That means that in terms of privacy preservation, Dash < Monero < ZCash

    🤝 3 ☑ 1 

Also, in Dash protocol, you are actually relying on a Masternode to preserve your privacy, because the master node that receive tx from you, can potentially log the correspondence between your address and your transaction. In ZCash, you compute everything yourself, so other nodes do not get any non-public information from you
To extend the comparison to Monero, in Monero, like in ZCash, no non-public information is transmitted to other nodes
31337 4:43 AM
wow, thanks for such an answer, didn't know that.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 4:47 AM
Yes, Dash's privacy protections are fairly weak

Hey I have a couple questions about Equihash
Can equihash be used to solve for blocks hashed in Sha256?
I may not have a full understanding of what Equihash does
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:01 PM
Hi @logic , think of Equihash and SHA-256 as two different types of puzzles that need to be solved to "prove" that work has been done. So you can't really use one puzzle to make the solving of another more efficient.
If you are interested in learning more about Equihash: https://z.cash/blog/why-equihash.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Why Equihash?

The important difference between them is Equihash uses significantly more memory to perform the computation.
[OFTC/palmtree] @rocket.cat Bot 3:42 PM
given zcash came partially out of bitcoin do you think that its value is strongly linked to it?
ledgerwatch 4:18 PM
@rocket.cat This is my personal opinion: ZCash did use a lot of Bitcoin code, but it brings a lot of interesting innovations (and hence unique value) with it. One of them, of course, if privacy preservation. Another one, which is not very obvious - is the blockchain compression. Using the techniques of succint non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARK or STARK without zk), one can generate a short proof that given hash of the block N, all previous blocks contain only valid transactions, form a valid hash chain, and have certain accumulated difficultly. That would allow a much faster bootstrapping of the "full" nodes, and also having SPV nodes with much higher security guarantees than right now. So it is also a scaling innovation. It might start with ZCash and later used in Bitcoin too.

ledgerwatch 4:08 AM
@blendmaster I think the reason you are not finding materials on the SNARK/START blockchain compression (please note that it does not need to be zero-knowledge in this case), is that it is not a well researched topic yet. I thought of this idea back in June, and I heard Eli Ben-Sasson talk about it during his talk at devcon3: https://youtu.be/bhUXa0C8Ybc?t=1076 (I encourage you to watch the whole video, but this is the moment he talks about compression)

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:55 AM
@nick-1 there is no Blockchain snapshots available to download. You just need to let the node run and it will eventually complete. The reason it seems to get "stuck" is because it's not just downloading it's also checking chain integrity.
And there were some pretty big blocks created a few months ago when a major exchange decided to sweep lots of small tx's into one, causing very full blocks that take a little longer to verify.
nick-1 7:59 AM

At me it hangs, and can and will be disconnected, after this here it appears. the same problem I had with currency dash. I was helped only by manually loading blocks into a folder. You can download them somewhere for this currency

A couple more questions about anonymity, I looked through the entire forum of answers I did not find!
To hide IP, you just need to create a purse with TOR, or you can create a purse without TOR, synchronize it, and connect TOR only when I conduct transactions.
As far as anonymously, transfers from one Z Z purse to another Z your purse even with the help of TOR, because the pools (exits) and hence the IP addresses will be the same!
Forgive me if this is stupid questions.

Virtualization is enabled on bios. I also have other pools for solomining on this vm. but only its on zcash that I experience late propagation.
dukeleto 5:10 PM
interesting
one 5:10 PM
its not all late. there are blocks that are equal or 1 sec late than blocktime
but sometimes as late as this one `43 secs`
dukeleto 5:14 PM
@one maybe you have a network adversary, messing with your BGP routes and studying your zaddr transactions....
titano 5:16 PM
@one are there no errors in your logs?
one 5:16 PM
I dont know `BGP routes` anyway thanks @dukeleto I will look more to find out.

titano 5:29 PM
Not familiar with blocknotify, but what I just read on Github is that it is just a script to send out notifications
It could be that running the script is delayed
somewhere in between running the script
did you check IO?

one 12:22 AM
let say I am a solo miner and found some blocks. Do I have to shield that mined coins first before you can transfer it?
ledgerwatch 12:35 AM
shielding is not mandatory. You can transact ZCash in a same way as bitcoin, if you wish to. I suspect that shielded transactions will become a thing when cross-blockchain decentralised exchanges will become a reality (like what Cosmos project is trying to do)
currently, if you swap various currencies around, and want a good price (or big amount), you need to go to an exchange, which identifies you, and it negates any shielding you've done before
if you don't need to de-shield yourself on every hop, then shielding would make sense
another reason why shielding can increase is some markets operating on ZCash shielded transactions. For example, if OpenBazzar starts supporting shielded ZCash, and merchants are happy to hold it (and not swap it to something else straight away and effectively revealing themselves), then it would work
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:17 AM
@ledgerwatch shielding is mandatory in one instance: coinbase must be shielded before use. So yes @one, you would need to do that.

I don't see why it would be too complex to add Zcash, it's built off Bitcoin
Unless they are trying to add Private addresses, that's a bit more work.

mineZcash Admin Owner 12:30 PM
Yes, Zcash is literally inventing the protocols as the Blockchain chuggs along. The upcoming Network Upgrade will have many improvements, just need to be patient, good software takes time.
[OFTC/Rolfi] @rocket.cat Bot 12:32 PM
yeah but what is that zsnark adoption of etherium. If they implement it, why use zcash?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:35 PM
What Ethereum added was something to make implementing zk-SNARKs cheaper (still not free). That will enable contracts running on Ethereum to verify zk-SNARKs, which enables new use cases, but doesn't replace a privacy-oriented cryptocurrency.
We can be fully-focused towards the latter goal, while Ethereum has other goals they are trying to balance.
ledgerwatch 12:37 PM
If you tried to implement private token transfers on Ethereum now, it would be 2-3 orders of magnitude less efficient than in ZCash. That will hold at least in the near future
my prediction is this: if Cosmos takes off (they promise to launch Feb 2018), and integrates ETH, and ZCash, and few others, the utility of ZCash will grow massively

There's an RPC method for doing that: `z_shieldcoinbase`

@mineZcash weird, if you look at the per-market breakdown, ZEC is priced at $384 in ZEC/KRW (Bithumb) and $330 elsewhere

Or maybe the conversion to USD is off in relation to KRW.
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:55 AM
Interesting 🤔
jasondavies 3:59 AM
Take this with a pinch of salt, but if you search around on Twitter some folks seems to think the prices are higher because there is a suspicion about solvency of the exchange. Like I said, this is just from searching on Twitter so don't read too much into it, but it could explain the 10% difference in prices.
It does make me think that pricing sites should use something more sensible when computing prices though.
Unfortunately you would probably just have to use a whitelist and exclude Bithumb if it has a consistent 10% price difference.
Also, if I understand correctly, they only have KRW pairs, so maybe that's offputting for arbitrage.

@jasondavies Bithumb prices always look a bit higher if converted from KRW to dollars. Even for Bitcoin: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets. I think it is most probably reflects the fact that arbitrage between exchanges via KRW and USD is not costless

guys , I transferred 1 cash 5 hours ago
how long will it be transferred to the account
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:50 AM
@erzitaliano it depends on lots of things, are you sending from exchange to exchange? Wallet to wallet?
erzitaliano 9:50 AM
exchange to exchange
cex to bitfinex
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:52 AM
Then you will need to check with them, some exchanges require more confirmations than others, a normal transaction takes maybe 10mins to get the first confirmation
I have had it near instantaneous too, just depends on the chain state
erzitaliano 9:53 AM
145 confirmations
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:53 AM
So it should be there
Some like Bittrex only require 20 to be valid

@here are you guys just going to let the price go sub 0.020BTC considering zcash was 3500BTC per coin on first day? where is your pride? uber boastful on the first day of trading now next to trash coin
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:49 AM
@one do not use the here function for random conversation
The first day there was not a single whole ZEC in exsistance so nobody actually paid 3500 BTC for a ZEC
I suggest you read up on the "Slow Start"
one 3:52 AM
its a question. not jsut random. looking for answers. Where is the very proud zcash?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:55 AM
What answer are you expecting? They work every day to improve Zcash. The market is it's own forces, I don't speculate on market prices.
And please don't abuse the notification system, or your account could be suspended.

    👍 2 

one 3:59 AM
what abuse? its just a question. are your taking offense? apology for that. Im just not seeing the very proud zcash lately.
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:01 AM
You ping everyone in the channel when you use the here notification, it's only to be used for _important_ notifications
I am proud of what they have accomplished if that is your question. In the course of a year they have built a Currency that offers the best privacy of a currency ever created (if used correctly)
And they have a roadmap to improve the rough edges like depreciating the transparent addresses and huge speed gains for processing.
This is not a coin that has huge Media press releases for every small event to try and influence market sentiment.
The future is bright, especially when Sapling is ready. I'm in it for the long term outlook, I'm not a day-trader.
And just for the record, I don't work for Zcash Company, and this chat is a public resource for the community, also not run by Zcash Company (so opinions are my own)
one 4:17 AM
Im not going to argue on merits Im just not seeing the once very proud zcash. I remember the price back then hold for several days at least. but today I'm seeing a let down on value. Is it the lowest so far?

hey all, I've transferred zcash from cex wallet to bitfinex wallet, I can see that the amount is credited in that address.
But bitfinex doesn't reflect the amount.
Can I get my zcash, if bitfinex continue to show as not deposited?
is there any way to get back my zcash?
ledgerwatch 5:20 AM
@shivamrawat10 If the coins left your address and are now in the address that Bitfinex gave you, it is now in custody of Bitfinex. You will not be able to get it back without Bitfinex's cooperation (unless you want to go and hack their servers, lol)
All exchanges are currently under unprecedented load. So it is not a surprise that things are not working or slower than usual
Please have patience or simply stay away from trading for a while
shivamrawat10 5:26 AM
Thanks for the info, I believe bitfinex doesn't have history of fraud,

shivamrawat10 5:28 AM
but it is really frustrating because now its in the hands of bitfinex and they dont reply.
ledgerwatch 5:29 AM
If you look here: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets you will see that Bitfinex is currently handling so much volume, they probably have massive stream of deposits and withdrawals, and their systems have never seen such volume before, so all sorts of bottlenecks get discovered. This is true not only for Bitfinex, but for any exchanges, and Shapeshift, etc.

Exchanges also have limited staff (you cannot just hire 100 people and getting them efficiently deal with support, you've got to spend time training them), so dealing with broken things manually is slow. All you can do it wait, I am afraid
next time you should take this into account, and perhaps send your coins to exchange when the volumes are a bit lower. It requires a bit of planning, but also help avoid impulsive decisions that end up costing you a lot

There is some way to make a transfer to another wallet without wait sync the blocks?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:15 PM
It needs to be synced to send funds to a new address
Syncing only takes a long time the first time, after that it's much faster
Depending on how long ago you last synced

john.bruhling 8:46 PM
I imagine if I wanted to open my wallet on a potentially comprised device, like a public computer, might be safer having to only import one address key. I know the wallet backup backs up all of them, thats just what I do normally anyways.

I know polkadot is looking closely into ZEC
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:00 AM
Then you know more than I 😉

Its 2 years away, but I think they want to achieve anonymity on demand in the cross blokchain communication by running transactions via ZEC blockchain
So I was wondering if maybe the same thing applies to cosmos network, that will be up and running in 3 months
I would believe that it would be a huge push forward tx wise if devs started to work together to enable other blockchains to be able to use ZEC
@mineZcash are you aware if ZEC will get smart contracts in the future ?
there is for example Rootstock for bitcoin doing something
and also ZEN Proticol (that has nothing to do with Zen Coin) - smart contracts with formal verification for BTC, I talked to devs there and they also said they are interested with ZEC
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:10 AM
Interesting, I do know that Zooko mentioned looking into smart contracts on the most recent roadmap post. https://z.cash/blog/roadmap-update-2017-12.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Zcash for Everyone

But that would be a long ways away, they have alot on thier plate with these upcoming upgrades
asmodat 7:12 AM
Zen Protocol devs say they will be able to supply ZEC with smart contracts after its available to them via cross blockchain communication protocols
so I think we should see it in less then 3 years

Hi guys
has anyone created a AWS ami for mining Z cash yet?
asmodat 8:27 AM
that would be extreamly unprofitable
eagleandserpant 8:36 AM
why? still noob btw
asmodat 8:39 AM
it stopped being profitable in November, but 2016
so I think you are too late to make profit on that
eagleandserpant 8:41 AM
So buying on an exchange is the best way to go now? eny good exhanges?
any

The apt update server is still down, is there another source for updating Zcash? This one still does not work: https://apt.z.cash/pool/main/z/zcash/zcash-1.0.13-amd64.deb
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:35 AM
Huh, I thought that had been fixed?
titano 9:35 AM
Not working here
the https://apt.z.cash is not reachable

    apt.z.cash
    Index of /

redirects to https://apt.z.cash/pool/main/z/zcash/ but nothing on that page

    apt.z.cash
    Index of /pool/main/z/zcash/

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:38 AM
Ok, raised that on our internal infrastructure channel
titano 9:38 AM
Thanks
Can't fetch the signing key neither
I'll check again next week
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:39 AM
But are you sure? I see a listing that includes the relevant deb on that page
titano 9:39 AM
Yes not from this IP
I'll try from one of the servers in the datacentre
mm works there
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:40 AM
https://apt.z.cash/pool/main/z/zcash/zcash-1.0.13-amd64.deb definitely exists
titano 9:40 AM
yes I see know
is there a firewall on that domain?
ooh I see
works now here too
maybe the admin fixed it just a sec ago?
or intermittent uptime
not sure, but two weeks ago it wasn't working either
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:42 AM
I don't know, sorry. But I don't think it was only just fixed
Yes there was definitely an issue before (due to a web server update if I remember correctly)
Maybe a caching problem causing you to temporarily not see the update?
titano 9:43 AM
no
but it's okay now
servers are updating
Thanks!
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 9:44 AM
No problem
titano 9:46 AM
I'll put a monitor on that URL, maybe there are more issues with connecting to that server. Not sure if that is the case, but maybe it would be a tiny frustration for a first time user.
Bummer, spoke too soon
Failed to fetch https://apt.z.cash/pool/main/z/zcash/zcash-1.0.13-amd64.deb Connection timed out after 120000 milliseconds
Can fetch it on the servers from the datacenter
so must be something else then.
Thanks Daira

A day ago I installed zcash wallet zcash4mac and then I bought zcash from Litebit.eu using the address that I found in the program. But I still did not receive the amount. Is that because zcash4mac still has to synchronize to about 100 percent? I could find the amount on the blockchain explorer using my address (at https://explorer.zcha.in/). Blockchain has synchronized at about 85 percent (already 24 hours busy with synchronizing). So will it arrive in my wallet after synchronization is complete?

I have an old amd c-60 motherboard. If I put a high end video card in it...would my ability to mine be seriously limited the by the slow CPU?

Rolfi: yeah, a celeron or i3 is probably much more powerful than an AMD c-60, which is why I ask.
[OFTC/vezult_] @rocket.cat Bot 7:28 AM
if you can run 6x or 12x cards with those though, then I'm guessing one or two cards + a c-60 would be fine.
[OFTC/vezult_] @rocket.cat Bot 7:28 AM
I'm also assuming that since this is almost exclusively computation, that IO isn't likely to be a limiting factor either.
[OFTC/vezult_] @rocket.cat Bot 7:29 AM
disk IO, I should say
[OFTC/vezult_] @rocket.cat Bot 7:29 AM
correct?
[OFTC/vezult_] @rocket.cat Bot 7:29 AM

It took me a couple of days to sync the blockchain from scratch but I have to say, the experience of using ZCash as a full node on macOS is pretty damn fine. I'm running zcashd from @kozyilmaz and the wallet by Vaklinov. I have configured it to run via a Tor proxy and IPv6 as well. Transactions using both transparent and private addresses are confirming in a couple of minutes and the general feeling is speed and reliability. Good work everybody. Looking forward to further improvements 👍

@dimitris.apostolou glad that it worked for you, hopefully next release will contain a lot macOS upstream fixes and finally we will be able to compile with clang!

@mike-2 no, and you probably wouldn't want to. When you start Zcashd it has a transparent address keypool, those addresses are used for change from transactions. See this article about how change works: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Change

Howdy! Is your Zcash node fully synced? You'll only see recent transactions when it's caught up to that portion of the blockchain.
nogi 5:49 PM
oh ok, it shows as 90.52%
That makes sense, thanks. One more question if i may. Can you use both zcash4mac and zcash4win on the same wallet?
NealJayu 5:56 PM
You're welcome. Yes, you'd be able to, though be aware that the more devices you have that wallet.dat file on, the more attack vectors you expose your wallet to.

Currently, full-node wallets aren't encrypted. So for storage of decent amounts, I'd recommend a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S. Just don't send your miner payouts directly to a hardware wallet, as they're usually many small outputs and generating a tx to move them off a hardware wallet taxes its resources and may error out.
nogi 6:02 PM
great thanks. What do people use for exchanges these days that don't charge the earth for transaction fees? I use btc markets but they don't support zec (yet)

What is the zcash project's policy for upstream bitcoin core code?

1. Do you try to port fixes and improvements that you do to bitcoin core?
2. To what extent do you cherry-pick fixes and changes from bitcoin core?
3. To what extent do you maintain source-level compatibility with bitcoin core to ease cherry-picking of patches from there?

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:43 AM
@per-gron can't speak for official policy, but here's what I've been doing:

1. Yes - e.g. we upstreamed a bunch of improvements to the Tor Control Port parser.
2. I always try to cherry-pick from upstream if possible, both to obtain features and refactors, and to avoid duplicating work.
3. We don't actively try to maintain compatibility in terms of our changes to the codebase (we make changes where they are most sensible, which can and does cause merge conflicts that I've had to deal with before), but I do try and pull in upstream patches as in-order as possible to reduce merge conflicts (and unnecessary work).
Here are some currently-open PRs for cherry-picking upstream changes (feel free to contribute by reviewing them if you want!):

@str4d Thanks for the info! I don't need to know official policy, I asked because I'm considering trying to write a few prs and it would be a shame of they were rejected because I don't understand how you work.
I'll try to review the PRs you linked when I get the chance, but I haven't worked on either the zcash or Bitcoin code bases before so it might not make sense for me to do that yet
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:00 AM
Here's a list of every PR that was merged upstream between 0.11 and 0.12 (we started from the 0.11.2 codebase): https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2074

    github.com
    Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 · Issue #2074 · zcash/zcash
    This issue is for tracking the PRs from upstream that would result in feature-parity with Bitcoin Core 0.12.0. We may not merge all of these, but we should track those we have decided not to merge ...

I've been working through that list bottom-to-top (but also pulling in later PRs where relevant), as well as looking at upstream features I want and then digging in to figure out all their commit-dependencies (to reduce or eliminate merge conflicts).
I would certainly appreciate more people working on this! 🙂
per-gron 3:04 AM
One task that I'm interested in picking up is to work towards removing the bdb dependency by introducing a DB abstraction layer
My limited understanding of the code base says that this is likely to cause conflicts with upstream code. That's why I originally asked the question
But I can definitely take a look at your PRs, that also seems like a good way to learn about the code basw
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:13 AM
See https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2598 for initial work towards that. It shouldn't actually cause too many conflicts; after that PR, it should just be a case of switching out which backend is used (so e.g. at compile-time, changing which `dbwrapper.cpp/h` is compiled/linked).

you don't need to register your public IP on flypool.. you only need that if you want to change your miner payout settings
Just go on https://zcash.flypool.org/miners/[YOUR-WALLET] and see if hashrate is the same you see on the miner (it takes about 15-30 minutes to update.. for correct estimated revenue you need to wait about 24h)

@str4d I reviewed https://github.com/zcash/zcash/pull/2217 and had some vaguely useful comments. As I said, it's not super easy for me to review code when I'm this new to the code base.

The PRs that you linked are quite old and seem to do a ton of stuff, often only somewhat related. Do you think it would make sense to submit them as smaller PRs that do closer to one thing each instead? It seems more likely to get at least some progress then... (Yes, it would be more Github web interface clicking, but otoh it's likely that the quality and speed of reviews would go up due to smaller PRs)

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 3:49 PM
@per-gron quite possible that splitting them up would make them easier to review. Part of the reason I made them the way they are though is that in some cases, I wasn't sure whether we even wanted those upstream changes - some of Bitcoin's policy decisions don't match ours. So it was partly to collate a bunch of related changes in one place.
The other part was, in at least some of those PRs, I was actually trying to merge something newer (some feature I wanted) that required a bunch of earlier PRs before it in order to not cause a bunch of merge conflicts.
What's happened with past iterations of these backporting PRs, is that we'll go through and decide which upstream PRs we want, which need more discussion, and which are definitely out, and then I'll rebase out the commits we don't want (usually into a separate branch so they don't get lost completely), and then we review and merge the remainder.
Oh, the *other* reason they often appear in one PR instead of several, is because of merge conflicts within the PR itself - e.g. if upstream merged 3 wallet PRs that touched the same code, we can't just merge the third one on its own without causing a bunch of conflicts, and then if we fix those, and then later decide to merge the first two PRs, we have all the same conflicts again in reverse.
So we couldn't actually get parallel review if we split them up - we'd have to review and decide on just the first PR, then just the second, and so on. Bundling them into one PR at least lets us concept ACK them all at once.
All that said, I definitely welcome feedback on how to improve this methodology 🙂

Hi all. I am interested in ZCash as a way to anonymize my financial position. I hold BTC, and was thinking about using a service such as Challengy to swap BTC for ZCash. Could I use a z-address with challengy for this purpose? Are z-addresses safe and fully functional? I have a z-cash node setup on a VM with Qubes OS.
bitcartel 6:19 PM
Last time I checked, changelly doesn't support private z-addresses.
Shapeshift has an API to look at recent tx, maybe Changelly does the same: https://shapeshift.io/recenttx/
You can use exchanges like Changelly to convert BTC to ZEC t-address, and then use your z-cash node to move to a z-address.
Make sure your VM has a decent amount of memory and CPU so that it can create the shielded tx.
(in a timely fashion)
george 6:22 PM
That was going to be my next question. Are there any reports of loss of funds, is it secure? I've seen some people say they have lost their funds using z addresses, but was skeptical of their claims.

@str4d Thanks for the detailed background information. As it stands today I don't know how I could help with these PRs. Here are two (mutually exclusive) options that could be useful:

1) Explain to me what it is you want me to look for and how I should report my findings in the PRs you linked. (Right now, it's unclear to me how I should communicate that I have done a review as well as how you would be able to use that knowledge to get confidence to merge)

2) For each PR you linked (perhaps only one at first), let me know which upstream PRs you want (I don't think I am in a position to make policy decisions). Then I can cherry-pick your work and provide a steady stream of smaller PRs (not in parallel) which you should be able to review and merge. If we get that ball rolling it seems doable to get ~2 upstream PRs in per week per PR that you linked, which is not exactly lightning fast but at least it's something?

Hi
I just started mining
how many accepted solutions yield payout of some kind?
Does that question make sense?
per-gron 12:26 AM
Would you be interested in accepting changes that move to/towards some other build system? Going through the issue list on Github it seems like the build system is a frequent source of pain: Issues on specific Linux distros, issues with non-portable shell scripts, issues with source changes not being picked up, issues with environment variables that mess with builds, I personally had some pain figuring out what needs to be preinstalled for the build to work etc.

IME getting good cross-platform sufficiently deterministic builds with autoconf/automake is quite difficult.

One option is Bazel (I work at Google so, yes, I am biased). It actually in practice gives true deterministic builds with proper support for incremental builds, it really is awesome. Gitian may not be needed because builds would just always be deterministic. It is heavier than most people are used to and opinionated towards a monorepo model of development though. I've also used CMake a lot and could try that as well, although it would not solve as many things as Bazel would.

Hello everyone. I set up my zcash node yesterday on an old laptop, 8GB RAM, i7, Nvidia m760. It is running on debian. I posted yesterday about this. I am interested an anonymizing myself. I have BTC, and plan to convert BTC to Zcash. The Zcash will be sent to a T-Address. The T-Address on my node will then send to my Z-address. If I want to hold other currencies besides Zcash, could I transfer Zcash out of my Z-Address into a different T-Address, and then into a different coin? Assuming my IP is masked, there shouldn't be any trace of my personal ownership to the alternative coins correct?

The z4cash application is extremely user unfriendly. I have no idea how to secure my wallet and on that note I sent funds to my account many hours ago to the first address in "My addresses" without seeing any funds added. I've been trying to synchronize with the block chain for over 4 hours and I'm only at 75%... will the transfer from shapeshift.io show up in my account when it hits 100%?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:38 PM
Hi @drew.murphy since you are running a full node the very first time you start the process it has to download the entire Blockchain, once this is complete you will see the most recent transactions show in your wallet
The good news is that once you sync up, the next time you start your node it only has to catch up from where you left off.
nathan Electric Coin Company 4:54 PM
@george I understand why you may need to transfer from other systems (like exchanges) to your t-addr first, and from there to your z-addr, but I don't think you would need to transfer from your z-addr to _your own t-addr_ before making a subsequent transfer.
You should be able to transfer directly from your z-addr to someone else's t-addr directly.
Also, if you happen to be using shapeshift, they support z-addrs directly, so in that case use their z-addrs for much better privacy.
If you go from `t → z → t` there are two primary considerations for privacy: the amounts going in and out, and the timing.
The less similar the amounts coming in and out, and the longer funds stay in "z-addr space" the better for privacy.
Does this help?
george 5:09 PM

Keep in mind it also verifies the chain integrity as it downloading, just because it appears to slow doesn't mean it has crashed.
Perhaps a lite wallet like Jaxx or Cryptonator would be more of what you are looking for, Zcash4win is a full node and wallet, not a lite wallet.

That issue will be fixed in our Overwinter Network Upgrade 0.
However, you may have encountered another issue, so the first step is to see if you can find the transaction in a block explorer like http://zcashnetwork.info/ or https://zcha.in/

    zcashnetwork.info
    Insight
    Zcash Insight. View detailed information on all testnet zcash transactions and block. {{ $root.title + $root.titleDetail }}

    zcha.in
    Zchain - Zcash Block Explorer & API
    Zchain: Zcash Block Explorer, Analytics Platform & API. Browse and search blocks, transactions, accounts, statistics and more.

Also, which wallet are you using to send?

Hello, i'm running a zec node for a few days and for now the bandwidth vs out avg is 2.90Mbit/s...does my node contact the same nodes or there is a particular tracker-list that asks everytime (Like torrents) ?
sami 1:14 PM
i see a thing.. my node is in netherlands and i make a lot of requests vs other nodes in amsterdam.. does mean that there is an algorithm (kinda like SPF) for the nodes inside the mainnet?

Wonderfull posting cute pictures ,investors ,money . Now lets talk about real stuff . Zcash - have no proper instructions how to install Zcash on Linux . Why you ask me? Because i try both from site and github here is always new bugs/problems ( obv im not an expert but its not about i can follow steps its easy ) . The big guys can't make official Wallet for Windows wow impressive ! you found somebody who will make it for you from community and post message like "INSTALL ON YOU OWN RISK" its a good joke my dear friends . You don't have online wallet - no need to refer 3rd party scam wallets i saw reviews . of course you have BIG NEWS on Forbes etc.. blah blah . BUT coins Useless and here is no real software to use . Just small advice from random guy , go to freelance sites hire decent software developer in team pay him 1k to start , add donation button to make software and make it official without message "DOWNLOAD ON U RISK" wtf is this ? who are you ? kids from wolrd of warcraft making bot or what? or real company?
Your product is useless im owner of 20 Zcash coins .
you have professor/mit guy in team etc.. but you can't make official wallet for Windows (most popular OS) and here is no Proper guide for Linux and what distro ? here is millions make at least for 5 populars ..
lu.pa 10:03 PM
@mineZcash and how is my question. I can't see "create account" for example:

$ zcash-cli help | grep account
addmultisigaddress nrequired ["key",...] ( "account" )
getaccount "zcashaddress"
getaccountaddress "account"
getaddressesbyaccount "account"
getbalance ( "account" minconf includeWatchonly )
getnewaddress ( "account" )
getreceivedbyaccount "account" ( minconf )
listaccounts ( minconf includeWatchonly)
listreceivedbyaccount ( minconf includeempty includeWatchonly)
listtransactions ( "account" count from includeWatchonly)
move "fromaccount" "toaccount" amount ( minconf "comment" )
sendfrom "fromaccount" "tozcashaddress" amount ( minconf "comment" "comment-to" )
sendmany "fromaccount" {"address":amount,...} ( minconf "comment" ["address",...] )
setaccount "zcashaddress" "account"

That's why I said, more documentation is needed
mineZcash December 14, 2017 3:45 PM
Hi @lu.pa , yes you can create as many accounts/addresses as you like to send and receive Zcash

@mineropaul Regarding wallets, the answer depends on your definition of "better". If ease of use is the most important, then Jaxx is probably the best choice at the moment. If security, privacy and reliability is what you are looking for, then go for the ZCash full node wallet.

@lu.pa https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=gvEibv6XJdWSRb5QC it seems you are confusing addresses with accounts. Addresses _are_ accounts. All you need to send/recieve Zcash is an address for others to send funds to. You can get a new Public address by using `./src/zcash-cli getnewaddress` leave off the account argument.
lu.pa December 15, 2017 10:16 PM

or if you want a private address you can use `./src/zcash-cli z_getnewaddress`

Hi all, just wanna ask u guys, as Poloniex currently disable their zcash wallet and I have my miner set to their address wallet, will I receive all the transaction after polo enable their wallet again ? or Will i lose all the zcash ? T.T
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 5:26 AM
@aimanalkhair Your transactions should be fine. When Poloniex re-enables the zcash wallet, I suggest you move your funds to a wallet that you control the private keys.

But you should contact Poloniex support and ask them when they are planning to re-enable it.
aimanalkhair 5:32 AM
@dimitris.apostolou That's a relief to hear that, I've contact them yesterday but I figure they will respond to my tickets maybe after 4 - 5 days..yeah I will look for proper wallet to store my zcash once the fund succesfully transferred, thx for replying dimitris.

    z.cash
    Zcash - Getting Started

same advice applies here as always: don't leave lots of currency sitting on _any_ exchange and you should be as safe as is possible

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 11:13 AM
@aleksandr86 Regarding the wallet backup issue, I think I know what's going on. I know how to fix using the command line. Before you launch the zcash client, you need to run the zcash daemon with arguments -exportdir=<dir> Where <dir> you enter the path you need to save your backup wallet. Then you launch the zcash client and the backup will work. I tested this on a macOS but I'm pretty sure you are hitting the same issue.
zaphod 11:14 AM
i see the list of exchanges. I'm looking for the exchange that people find the most reliable and the most liquid.
vcavallo 11:14 AM
@aleksandr86 the general idea is you want to safely store the seed phrase - maybe written down and laminated, stored in a safe (and one offsite?) -- but now you have the question of "how do i secure my safe?" 😆
zaphod 11:14 AM
i'd rather not have to add personal bank information.
(to the exchange)
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 11:15 AM
@aleksandr86 Regarding the private keys, go to Own Addresses tab, right click on any address and select Obtain private key.
vcavallo 11:15 AM
@zaphod somewhere along the way you'll need to let some exchange know something about you, financially (even just a credit card), if you're going to somehow give them $usd. I have coinbase + gemini as the only exchanges that have bank info on me - then from those I'll send btc or whatever else to other wallets on smaller exchanges
I am by no means an authority on any of this, however.
zaphod 11:24 AM
well, if I can get an exchange to simply answer an e-mail or chat that would be a start.
🙂
i'll check out kraken again. i think they're based in CA. The big issue here is to make sure the *exchange* is transparent and operational.
vcavallo 11:27 AM
if you don't like the look of any of exchanges that trade zcash you can do what I do - find a reputable exchange that _doesn't_ trade zcash, buy btc there with usd and send to the zcash-exchanging-site of your choice
a few hoops to jump through and fees to pay, but maybe worth it to you for paranoia's sake
zaphod 11:40 AM
pro tip: just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you. LOL
anyway, I don't mind working with an exchange and providing information. Problem is the exchanges aren't responsive. Kraken, for example, right now won't server up a password reset e-mail so I can get in.
so, with things being that unreliable, it puts a damper on things.
vcavallo 11:41 AM
a pro-tip and Nirvana line in one 😉

My "zcash4win" 1.0.11 is crashing and says it can't connect but yet here I am, connected
how do I upgrade to 1.0.12 without losing my wallet funds?
I checked around, saw nothing on how to upgrade. Ran the installer for 1.0.12 and it says I must uninstall 1.0.11 first, I don't want to do that when I've got coins in my wallet, so what do I do guys? help
arielg 12:49 AM

Aurrius 12:50 AM

thanks
When will the wallet auto update itself? is that possible to make it update to latest version instead of in-installing and re-installing?
un*
it seems a bit tedious and sketchy
Also, this update was probably why my online wallet got delayed even though i saw no message about maintenance on wallet status
Anyway thanks. Just leaving my thoughts here for ya. Hope you can keep improving, take care.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:18 AM
@Aurrius Just to be safe, make a copy of your wallet.dat file, then uninstall 1.0.11 and install 1.0.12

Pretty sure it will automatically find your wallet but even if it doesn't, you can always copy back the wallet.dat file.

@bobfash You need to contact the exchange, you should have gotten a txID you can look up ona site like zcashnetwork.info
Most exchanges wait for 20 confirmations before they credit your account

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:03 AM
@krunch3r Yes, you can just send the funds to the new wallet. Assuming this is a wallet (not an exchange) that you control the private keys, the mining fee is 0.0001 ZEC. It is highly recommended that you use a full node.

zooko Electric Coin Company 10:24 AM
I think somebody [*] ought to do an airdrop of ZEC to certain populations.

    👍 1 

It's fun to imagine ways to do it.
For example, here's something I was fantasizing about in the shower yesterday:
1. Take a stash of ZEC that is worth a substantial amount, like a million U.S. dollars [*].
2. Split it into 10 batches, so each one is worth about $100,000.
3. Pre-announce that once a week for the next 10 weeks it will be split evenly among everyone who matches a certain criteria [**].
So two open questions:
[*] Where is this money coming from? Zcash company, Zcash Foundation, crowd-funding project, change the consensus rules to allocate some ZEC to this instead of to miners, change the consensus rules to allocate some ZEC to this instead of maintaining the 21M monetary base cap, some other company buys a bunch of ZEC to do this, some other philanthropic org buys a bunch of ZEC to do this, … ?
[**] What are the criteria? Whatever they are they have to be sybil-resistant.
And at the same time, it would be really helpful if there is a virality, like people who see the others getting the airdrop in week N can take action to make themselves eligible in week N+1.
These two are a little bit in tension with each other, because the best way to be sybil-resistant is to use a criteria that is backward-looking to before the announcement.
Almost anything is sybil-resistant in that case, and almost nothing is if you let people qualify after the announcement.
E.g. Everyone who has committed a patch to any open source project on github before now. Fantastic sybil-resistance! Compare to: Everyone who commits a patch to any open source project on github in the next month. Shitty sybil-resistance!
E.g. Every Bitcoin UTXO which is "below water" — has less BTC in it than the current transaction fees would cost to move it, at this moment: great Sybil resistance! Every Bitcoin UTXO which is below water in the next month: shitty sybil resistance.
So, pick some criteria which you can't fake or sybil after you hear about it, but which there is a big enough population of qualifiers that it could virally spread _within_ that population during the 10-week run.
E.g. Everyone who already had a WhatsApp account in South Africa before this announcement (sybil-resistant), _and_ who opts in by sending our WhatsApp bot a message (virality).
</brainstorm>
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:53 AM
@patrizio how do you mean? Is this an address you control? What does the balance in your wallet say?

Don’t copy past wallet.dat. use export/import functions.

Hi guys, merry Christmas 🙂 I have a problem and I hope someone can help me. I did two withdrawal from Poloniex to my Ledger zec wallet. The first one was a test and I sent 0.00300000 and the transaction was complete, I can track the address and the Txid on Zchain and I can see the credit on the wallet. The second time I sent a bigger amount from poloniex to the same zec wallet but the address was different. The problem is that on Poloniex the transaction is complete but I can't track the address and the Txid on Zchain (page not found), and I never received the coin on my wallet.
First Transaction: Address: t1JcPRka3XUsUXREuNPE1W2ByRzMkfgJCGp Txid: 6d3a2068803045f062b45bb06a3768130bda6484a4fb16ab668fcf64a6934c90

I have an issue when mining ZCash. Maybe someone can help me out.
I installed Ubuntu 16.04 (erase disk and install) and i have two R9 280X cards. Now i see GPU benchmarks for this card around 300 Sol/s. I'm only getting around 90 Sol/s PER Card. I'm using the AMDGPU-PRO drivers... What's going on here...
My stats were slightly off there, it's even worse: I should get 300 Sol/s per card, im getting 43 Sol/s per card.

    Important: this will work with only zcash 1.0.3 So, you will have to use https://github.com/zcash/zcash/tree/v1.0.3 when downloading zcash I thought I'd share with you all what I have learned in building a privet (or if you want public) zec pool. I pursued this in hope that maybe if can build my own farm, I will have it work on my own private pool, instead of using a public pool.

This person used to harshly criticize Zcash, and now she's defending Zcash: https://twitter.com/EncryptionGirl/status/945668708827123712 . I'm glad I responded to her (publicly and privately) acknowledging the validity of her concerns enough times that she eventually came to believe that we are sincere in our mission.

    EncryptionGirl[NoBCH] on Twitter
    @urza_cc @zooko Absolutely. Zcash academics are doing real science. When concerns are raised, I have found they listen and respond in a reasonable manner. The way that the IOTA team responded to valuable feedback from MIT Media Lab's will severely tarnish their reputation among academics.

It's a good data point in favor of — for some people — neither ignoring them not flaming them, but instead responding under the assumption that they are sincere and they want what's best.
Not that this is the most common data point. For a lot of critics, I don't think there's anything we could say to them directly that would change their minds. But for them maybe if we write and circulate more "anti-FUD" writings that will help.

I agree 100% @zooko the way you and the developers of Zcash continue to be professional when facing criticism and try to address the concerns raised are one of the key reasons I support Zcash
It's always better to be open to any concerns or ideas raised and react in a positive manner, than it is to try and tear down the character of the person who is rasing the question
A good anti-fud post always goes further than a bunch if negative comments on Twitter or Reddit
Outside observers can see the difference

@zooko You’re absolutely right. To me, the thing that differentiates Zcash from other cryptocurrencies is that it almost gives a sense of wisdom, which in turn brings stability. While everyone is busy trying to spin off novelty one-trick pony coins, the Zcash team is doing research and taking strides leading to the next truly good improvement to blockchain tech. The MPC ceremony is a fantastic example of this, it’s something that’s never been done before. Regardless of who was right or wrong in a situation, if I saw a Zcash team member act respectfully and maturely throughout the conversation, it would further reinforce the ideas above. Anything else, and I would probably question myself. IMO, first you’ve got to put yourself in their shoes. Practically tell them they’re right in order to diffuse the situation, then add in your point so that it seems inevitable and make it easy for them to accept that point. If you flame them, the probability of this happening is 0. The only time you should ignore them is if they’re clearly trolling and attempting to invoke a reaction from you (i.e. there isn’t a single honest point in the text they’ve written). But yeah, that’s my rule of thumb for online etiquette, haha

And I guess that’s why I happily spent my Christmas Eve submitting an MPC attestation!

Not hash, like Ethereum

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:24 PM
The basic Zcash miner doesn't use the GPU, you need separate software for that
An i5 CPU would get about 15Sols/s
GPU is much better for mining than CPU

isn't that a form of ASIC?

It is memory hard, the bottleneck becomes Memory Bandwidth, not quantity

Memory is still expensive, and big jumps in bandwidth don't happen often or cheap

Hi! I need your help ...
How I might get info of zadd via txid? Where zadd was made on my server ... I do not understand (((
after receiving a notification from walletnotify how to automatically find where it came to, using zcash-cli
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:42 AM
@917989 you should be able to use `z_listreceivedbyaddress` and see all addresses that have received funds
There are many other zcash cli commands https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/doc/payment-api.md

    github.com
    zcash/zcash
    zcash - Zcash - Internet Money

Also, if you have the txid you can use a block Explorer like zcashnetwork.info to see the time/day of that transaction
917989 7:48 AM
thank
yes, but it turns out I need to store the state of all addresses to understand where the coins went, to which of the zadd addresses ... which is not very convenient in my case ...
and to use z_listreceivedbyaddress, you must already know the address =((
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:50 AM
You don't need to have multiple z_addresses, 1 is enough for maximum privacy https://z.cash/blog/shielded-address-contexts.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Payment Contexts & Reusing Shielded Addresses

You can't know the balance of a private z_address unless you _own_ the z_address that's the whole point of having a _private address_
You also can't look up a list of z_addresses that have been created by others
917989 7:57 AM
I read the article, thanks, thought understood, but the question arose. how then to understand which client how many send coins to enroll these funds on his balance in my store?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:00 AM
So you have a z_address for your store, and want to be able to see who sent it to you, is that correct?
Or you just want to keep track of which customer sent how much?
You could generate a unique z_address for each customer and not share that address with others, thus knowing that only one person could have sent to that address
Or you could have the customer put a note in the memo field. The memo field is also encrypted with the transaction.
917989 8:07 AM
yes, I need to automate the receipt of payments from customers with further enrollment. The client insists on zadd.
1) the store registers the customer and gives it a zadd
2) The client forwards this zadd coin
3) zcashd notifies my store that there is a transaction (walletnotify)
4) my store should receive information on the transaction,

Although you need to manually look up the memo for each transaction you receive manually, I opened an issue about this on the Github https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/2708

    github.com
    Encrypted memo not brought to the attention of memo recipient · Issue #2708 · zcash/zcash
    Users who receive an encrypted memo via Zcashd have to manually check through all of their received transactions to see if a memo is attached increasing the likelihood that the recipient will miss ...

I don't think there is a "wallet notify" command to alert when funds have been received to a private address, you have to query the cli manually
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:17 AM
There is the old Bitcoin wallet notify command https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/24457/how-do-i-use-walletnotify

    bitcoin.stackexchange.com
    How do I use walletnotify?
    I have bitcoin daemon and I want to use the walletnotify option with a json-rpc call. Some of the examples use a "transaction.sh" file for walletnotify. What is it for? What do I have to write in ...

But _if_ that works in Zcash (I don't know if it does) it would likely only work on t_addresses
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 8:19 AM
@yunya Ah, THAT Zcash plan is a known scam. Stay away.
917989 8:26 AM
yes, quite right, it works so long as the addresses remain t_addresses. z_addresses this does not work as I would like. walletnotify works properly, and I just get txid through it. And here is how I can not understand further, on kokoy from z_addresses this transaction came ... ((((
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:34 AM
The way z_addresses work, the recipient does not have a way to know what z_address the funds came from, ever.
If you could see that information, then that would be a way to track funds across the network which would be a problem to maintain the privacy of users.
Which is why I mentioned the memo field, it may be a way for you to know which customer sent you funds.

I'm a "normie" who recently bought a Ledger Nano S. I executed a small transaction to remove some Zcash from the Bittrex exchange to my Ledger hardware wallet. The transaction successfully went through to my Ledger. I then MISTAKENLY copied the previous "transaction address" rather than my "receiving address" to execute a second larger transaction. As you would expect, the coins never showed up. Can Bittrex get them back for me, or are the coins lost forever? Did anyone actually receive them? Thanks, Phil

@phil, what's a "transaction address"? Whatever it is, if it didn't start with `t` or `z` then it's not a valid Zcash address, so the funds could not have been sent.

It started with a "t". I just sent you a direct message.

New Year's best dream wish: "Amazon announces payments with Zcash shielded transactions".

Zcash is automatically boosted to no.1 in CoinMarketCap, commerce finally becomes secure and private, "best crypto debate" is over, the world is a better place.

Business is simple, no? 🙂

mineZcash Admin Owner 9:51 AM
@dimitris.apostolou that is quite the dream 😁 it will take a long time for a major player like Amazon to get on board. The first thing that needs to happen is for cryptocurrency to become more stable otherwise they will never accept 10/15/30% swings in value in a 24hr period. Those kinds of swings can crush a retailer who operates on slim 5-20% margins.
My hope is that with wider adoption of cryptocurrencies the prices will normalize enough for the big players to start accepting and then once it's "no big deal" to use a cryptocurrency at a grocery store or Amazon, _then_ the public will realize that having all their transactions easily visible to anyone on a public ledger _isn't_ an advantage.

hi I do have a question, nearly 24h ago I send 2 zec from jaxx to my yobit address... now I have 6+ confirmations in the jaxx wallet but the transaction and the address itself cannot be found in the zchain
on yobit I can see incoming deposit of 2 zec... but no progress...

If it is incoming on Yobit then you should be fine. Some exchanges require 20 confirmations

@maged It's not explicitly on the roadmap but people have expressed their opinion on it at various points. I think it would be nice to remove them but only if there is no loss of functionality. I don't think there is any chance they will be removed any time soon (they will not be removed in the Sapling update, for example).
