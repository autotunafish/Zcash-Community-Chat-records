Slack is a proprietary platform, while rocket.chat is open source, plus Slack has very high fees for the size of the community that Zcash has grown into.

so the server is hosted by using your the opensource Rocket software?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:32 PM
yes, rocket.chat is a great platform
jeewaka 4:33 PM
i mean you are hosting it, that means you can access the archives
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:35 PM
yes, unlike Slack where you have to pay to keep history beyond a certain point
which is why sometimes in the Slack right now you see the error message "your team has over 10,000 messages, please upgrade your membership to see them"

rocket also has a pretty robust Github community working to improve it
jeewaka 4:51 PM
so is this replacing the official slack or another place to chat about zcash?
do the admins have more control
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:52 PM
the Slack will soon be phased out
jeewaka 4:53 PM
phased on and moved here?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:53 PM
yes, thats one of the better things about Rocket.chat is that there are several roles, moderators, admins and custom that you can create to help the community
jeewaka 4:53 PM
phased out
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:54 PM
shut down, and moved here

jeewaka 4:56 PM
Can we have the Official teams saying ZTeam or something
instead of Admin
well maybe admin if they are of this
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:57 PM
go Zteam go!
they also have admin privileges here
jeewaka 4:58 PM
no, I mean a lot of people ask if somebody is a official Team member
this would eliminate those questions and also false answers to fud
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:59 PM
You wont see anyone (except myself) with a admin tag unless they are part of the official Zcash team
jeewaka 5:09 PM
so the rest of the Zcash team is Admin too?
shows Str3d as admin
ahh ok, rest of the team is admin
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:19 PM
I agree with jeewaka that it might be confusing / annoying if the conversation is split between two places. So jeewaka, what we're planning is for the 'official locus' of dev chat to remain in our community slack until a pre-announced switch-over point. So theoretically you can ignore this channel until then. üòâ
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:21 PM
Indeed, the official switch has not happened....yet
nathan Electric Coin Company 5:22 PM
Hm... Maybe we need a blog post and/or FAQ explaining this transition decision, because I'll guess a large fraction of participants will have the same questions.

I'm so happy this currency is anonymous (aside from the bug) because if we weren't going in this direction I would not want to imagine the alternative
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:32 PM
Anonymous and decentralized are the keys to a successful private cryptocurrency
nathan Electric Coin Company 6:42 PM
Here's a "privacy narrative" I've been working on: Zcash is all about _privacy_, rather than just _anonymity_. Anonymity is a subset of privacy.
An example of non-anonymous privacy is that a brick-and-mortar shop can paste their z-address QR code to a billboard, and everyone can know that's their address, but still no one can see who's paying them, who they are paying, or how much ‚ì© is flowing in and out of that address.

don't suppose there is talk about some ASIC hardware in the pipeline
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:19 AM
It would be interesting to see if someone comes out with specialized hardware for Zcash, but it's very expensive to beat existing CPU/ GPU costs
pavel.tarasov 7:20 AM
right so the questions may be a little silly but here goes:
1. what happens to the notes once they are spent?
2. Can the coin sender view the transaction details on the ledger the same way the receiver can use his viewing key?
3. Can bitcoin be converted into the note by passing it into the public input of a JoinSplit transaction, then output a note that is addressed to the receiver?

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:02 AM
@pavel.tarasov 1) They still exist on the blockchain, but because their nullifier has been published, they will no longer be accepted by full nodes in new transactions (preventing double-spends). 2) Yes if they keep their ephemeral key for that transaction IIRC, but it's not implemented yet. 3) Not possible to use Bitcoin as a transparent input, but you could user it to purchase transparent ZEC and use that as an input, or purchase shieldedZEC in the first place.
(I'm probably wrong about 2 FWIW, it's really early in the morning...)
akiron 8:05 AM

pavel.tarasov 8:05 AM
thanks @str4d and im assuming there is a way to convert the shieldedZEC into transparent ZEC same way it was available in zerocoin paper if im not mistaken? if this is still available then how is it accomplished?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:06 AM
All happens in the JoinSplit
A JoinSplit has a vpub_old that takes funds from the transparent value pool, and a vpub_new that adds to it
The ZKP asserts that the sum of the input note values + vpub_old == the sum of the output note values + vpub_new
This is how transaction fees are paid for JoinSplit
(vpub_new non-zero, no transparent outputs -> vpub_new is the fee)
And likewise if there are transparent outputs, the fee is whatever is left over like usual

marekkon5 10:11 AM
hello, i am new here, is it more proffittable to mine on low hasrate pool if i have low hashrate or its same on all pools
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:12 AM
If you scroll up in this channel you can see several other open source chat alternatives that cold be considered if you wanted to host your own
@marekkon5 it depends on the pool, your percentage of :ZEC: will be based off how much you contribute to the pool
Smaller pools you may get a larger percent, but they might not win blocks as often
marekkon5 10:14 AM
so that means it will be almost the same
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:15 AM
You can always try a pool for a few days, and then compare to others
marekkon5 10:15 AM
i have low h/s so i need to mine at least for 12h to get payout
Do You think that zcash price will increase?

Then joining a pool will be your best bet

Zcash basic usage anonymity summary (much thanks to mineZcash):
1) Two addresses are involved in any transaction (Sender, Receiver)
2) Address information is recorded in the blockchain
3) Anonymity is provided on a per-type-of-address used basis
Use cases:
A) t-addr (non-anonymous) --> t-addr (non-anonymous) [No anonymity]
B) t-addr (non-anonymous) --> z-addr (anonymous) [Receiver anonymity only]
C) z-addr (anonymous) --> t-addr (non-anonymous) [Sender anonymity only]
D) z-addr (anonymous) --> z-addr (anonymous) [Both sender *and* receiver anonymity]
Pro tip:
If you buy Zcash from an exchange that will only send to t-addrs, to anonymize the funds, just send them from your own t-addr to your other z-addr.

thats not added on the block ledger im assuiming??
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:26 AM
All transactions have to be recognized by the ledger to be considered valid, its just the way you spend / receive the coins affects what others can see about the transaction
pavel.tarasov 5:31 AM
so when i convert zecs then everyone can see that a public address has just converted one zec?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:34 AM
They will be able to see that a transparent address received the number of ZEC (thats why its called transparent) if you want to make a truly anon transaction you need to send from z add to z add
pavel.tarasov 5:35 AM
i see thanks
Sorry thats also done vai JoinSplit right?
pavel.tarasov 5:52 AM
also just to make sure, the viewing key is used to view incoming transactions, but can also be used to view details of outgoing transactions provided the transaction is going to a t address and not z address correct?
pavel.tarasov 7:19 AM
also can a shielded note be sent form z add to t add?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:29 AM
mineZcash November 10, 2016 5:21 AM
Yes, you can send from a z address to a t address
pavel.tarasov 7:31 AM
in that case the sender can also view the transaction with their viewing key? and how does it differ from sending z-to-z address?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:32 AM
The sender will be able see to the the transaction on the Blockchain because it went to a t address
You only really need to use the viewing key to verify a private transaction because it cannot be seen on the public Blockchain otherwise
Think of the z addresses as a black box, whatever you do inside the box can't be seen on the public Blockchain
It is between you and the recipient
pavel.tarasov 7:37 AM
so when i send a shielded zec with z address to a t address, everyone can see the transaction, but obviously you remain anonymous and so does the value of zec?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:38 AM
As soon as you send to a t address it is no longer private.
pavel.tarasov 7:38 AM
but your identity remains private?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:40 AM
The Blockchain will record that it came from a z address, but nobody will be able to see the history if those coins beyond that single transaction
pavel.tarasov 7:41 AM
but is your identity pseudonymous still? so that eventually you can be tracked because you used the z address?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:45 AM
Bitcoin works by keeping a ledger of every single transaction, because every single transaction is transparent it can be tracked back to its origins. Z addresses break this chain ao they cannot be tracked beyond a certain point
pavel.tarasov 7:46 AM
i understand.Is it possible to limit the transaction to a particular value? say no more that 2 Zecs per transaction?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:49 AM
Yes, you can choose to send however many coins you want in and out of t and z addresses, as long as you have enough coins in the wallet
pavel.tarasov 7:50 AM
i mean i may have 10 zecs but i can only send 2 at any given time?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:50 AM
Sure, or .002 if you wish
pavel.tarasov 7:51 AM
yes, but like a system limit, so that its not possible to send less than 2 or more than 2?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:59 AM
I don't know of any limits other than the funds in your wallet and the transaction fee

Zcash uses the same fee model as bitcoin, whatever amount you send it will be minus the fee for the recipient

@pavel.tarasov this is my understanding: transparent value pool is used for both transparent ZEC and fee. If transparent ZEC are sent to a shielded address, they enter into the transparent pool and become consumed by the joinsplit with any remainder in transparent pool being used for tx fee. If shielded ZEC are sent to a transparent address, then funds exit the joinsplit into the transparent value pool for output to transparent address wth any remainder in the transparent value pool being used for tx fee. If sending from shielded address to shielded address, fee is the only thing that exits joinsplit into transparent value pool. If sending from transparent to transparent, value enters and exits from the transparent value pool with remainder as fee (and no joinsplits occur)
pavel.tarasov November 10, 2016 9:11 AM

is 2 buy it from some1 who is trustworthy & uses decentralized im such as tox

just better opsec
leave as less traceable transaction records on the centralized exchanges' servers as u can

technically speaking, no 1 can link those shielded zecs doesn't mean no 1 can correlate them 2 the transparent 1s

hence the opsec countermeasures like time delay & random volume per transaction r still necessary

All the coinbase transactions that aren't being kept in their originating addresses are protected before any subsequent transparent transactions can occur. What does that do for correlation?

dom 6:50 AM
I get it but the slack client is way better on mobile (and slightly better on desktop anyway). Additionally, I and a lot of other people already have slack and would prefer to avoid installing yet another client.
God I just tried to type the above message on Rocket from Android and I noticed a no-no bug which is cursor always jumping to other parts of the message if you start selecting words to delete and moving to edit typing errors, which happen way more on mobile.
Please keep the slack relay enabled at least till rocket gets better on mobile!

    ARM mining - Raspberry Pi 3
    Hey all, I'm thinking about mining on Raspberry Pi 3, because 4x1.2GHz and 1gb RAM seems to be nice for it. I tried to download and make the nheqminer on it, but it fails with error "Could NOT find Threads (missing: Threads_FOUND)". Probably the reason is the miner use SSE2 / AVX1 / AVX2, and these are only in x86 architecture, not ARM. What do you think guys, how much work to rewrite the neccessary parts in nheqminer to mine on ARM based processors? Other question: whether is worth it? ...

it will be already at 12.5 zec

It should have arrived at the 12.5 by Block 20,000. Interestingly, It was actually going to be block 5,000 initially but when they switched to 2.5min block time it also had to jump to 20,000 because of the 4x

@mineZcash will the block time go back to 10mins after block #20000 and if not what differences would this mean with bitcoin?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:52 AM
No, the 2.5min block time will remain the same
Not mich difference really, the total will be the same as bitcoin, (total 21M and total 50coins every 10 min)
Just faster blocks
dom 9:04 AM
so mining all of the 21million coins will go faster then iwth bitcoins?
when is it scheduled to finish if you remembe?
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:05 AM
It will take the same time because everything else is the same
It there will be a halving of the block reward every 4 years too
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:07 AM

Can anyone help with why I can't connect to any servers while running zcashd?
bitcartel 2:44 PM
@geebeedeebee Do you have `addnode=mainnet.z.cash` in your zcash.conf file? Any error messages in `debug.log` ?
geebeedeebee 3:03 PM
@bitcartel do i call up the debug.log on command line?
bitcartel 3:05 PM
Should be located at: $HOME/.zcash/debug.log
geebeedeebee 3:08 PM

mstg 3:47 PM
@geebeedeebee `cat ~/.zcash/debug.log | less` and check if there are any error messages
geebeedeebee 3:50 PM
thanks @mstg
and there's No such file or directory found
mstg 3:53 PM
Add `addnode=mainnet.z.cash` to your zcash.conf
or try: `./zcashd -daemon` then `./zcash-cli addnode mainnet.z.cash add` then wait a little bit then do `./zcash-cli getpeerinfo` to confirm connections
geebeedeebee 3:54 PM
ok
lol, first message is...
Error: To use zcashd you must set an rpcpassword in the configuration file:
/Users/adm/Library/Application Support/Zcash/zcash.conf
It is recommended you use the following random password:
rpcuser=zcashrpc
rpcpassword=7zEbycbR5XXKX8FPGcDxtQ95uDuSAYqLy6Y5ec4N9E9e
(you do not need to remember this password)
The username and password MUST NOT be the same.
If the file does not exist, create it with owner-readable-only file permissions.
It is also recommended to set alertnotify so you are notified of problems;
for example: alertnotify=echo %s | mail -s "Zcash Alert" admin@foo.com
mstg 3:57 PM
you need to create a zcash.conf file first in $HOME/.zcash/zcash.conf
@geebeedeebee run this: `mkdir -p ~/.zcash; echo "rpcuser=zcash\nrpcpassword=hHhj1dpBHbRj\naddnode=mainnet.z.cash" >> ~/.zcash/zcash.conf`
then run `./zcashd -daemon`
geebeedeebee 4:00 PM
well I at least found the debug.log

ok
still the same error message.
mstg 4:09 PM
oh gee, didnt notice you were on windows sorry.
i meant mac
geebeedeebee 4:10 PM
that's ok.
i tried the mac way and it still didn't work.
i allowed for the changes
i've also been stuck trying to build ant
mstg 4:11 PM
`mkdir -p "/Users/adm/Library/Application Support/Zcash/"; echo "rpcuser=zcash\nrpcpassword=hHhj1dpBHbRj\naddnode=mainnet.z.cash" >> "/Users/adm/Library/Application Support/Zcash/zcash.conf"`
what about this?
geebeedeebee 4:11 PM
lemme try that.
still same error message
mstg 4:14 PM
Well thats weird, you should have the required zcash.conf file now
geebeedeebee 4:17 PM
I have a zcash.conf file, but....
mstg 4:18 PM
im gonna try this on my mac. give me a minute
geebeedeebee 4:18 PM

I did it!

Hello
I am new
how are you
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:29 PM
Well welcome
tsowho 6:29 PM
Thanks.
I'd like to know more about Zcash and how I can get involved as well as others
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:31 PM
It's always quiet around here on the weekends. What would you like to know?
tsowho 6:32 PM
well from the start. are you like the inventor? *smiles*
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:33 PM
No, I'm just a supporter, there are many from the development teams that come here too
I run the chat, and a website for people to learn about Zcash
tsowho 6:36 PM
Excellent. So as a student starting from nursery in zcash, what can you tell me about it
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:37 PM
Well, how much do you know about crypto-currency like Bitcoin? Have you ever used Bitcoin?
tsowho 6:39 PM
I am a bitcoin investor
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:39 PM
If you stop by my site, minezcash.com there is a short history of Zcash if you want to know how it began
tsowho 6:39 PM
Yes I hhave used and am using
ok sire will do
sure*
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:41 PM
Ok, so Zcash is similar to bitcoin, but it is alot more private. Zcash has two types of transactions: public and private that let users choose if they want others to see the transaction on the Blockchain
tsowho 6:41 PM
I'd really like to get involved as I know zcash has tendencies to remain strong taking into consideration its launch date
still can any of the mining programs work with windows or strictly Linux
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:42 PM
It's still in it's "sprout" stage right now
tsowho 6:43 PM
üòç
123 6:43 PM
Will you type in Chinese?
tsowho 6:44 PM
well you got to get me involved then
123 6:44 PM
‰Ω†Â•ΩÔºü
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:44 PM
Linux is the only official supported OS, but if you stop by forum.z.cash you will see some have made it for Windows and OSX
But the other platforms can be tricky to set up, so for me I just use Ubuntu
123 6:45 PM
The price has fallen too crazy recently
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:46 PM
@123 the price still needs to find normal. The slow start is still in effect until 20,000 block
tsowho 6:47 PM
Ok Ubuntu sounds more like it
123 6:47 PM
ok
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:47 PM
Actually I would argue that the price started too crazy, now is getting to normal
123 6:50 PM
Oh
However, you feel very surprised, the Chinese over the wall over to join this chat
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:57 PM
We have a channel for Chinese #zcash-zh you can invite them
tsowho 6:58 PM
ok so where should i get started
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:58 PM
Are you looking to begin mining?
Or just learning?
123 6:58 PM
ok
geebeedeebee 6:58 PM
Hi, are you able to help me configure my miner/mining acct?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:59 PM
To join a pool? @geebeedeebee
geebeedeebee 7:01 PM
I've joined supernova.cc and I think I have set up a worker and an address. but since I have my miner setup, it seems to be mining, but I see no activity on my pool dashboard.
123 7:02 PM
Now the price has fallen to 954 yuan, which is 140.1087 dollars
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:02 PM
You may need to ask @ocminer he runs supernova
geebeedeebee 7:02 PM
thank you. I'll hope he's around. I'm getting antsy over here lol
Do you know what these hash rates mean? This is the output my miner is giving me: 3.35 H/s, 6.30 Sol/s
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:04 PM
6.30, looks like you are CPU mining?
geebeedeebee 7:04 PM
yes just to test
123 7:05 PM
My cpu came up with between 15 and 18 Sol / s
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:05 PM
Zcash uses equihash algorithm, Solutions a Second, more is better
geebeedeebee 7:06 PM
well, I don't really want to be tasking my main computer lol
I'd rather a designated miner.
so this is fine for now.
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:06 PM
Some CPU with AVX can do 30 sols/s depends on CPU
But GPU can get you 60-70 or more
geebeedeebee 7:07 PM
I'm just not sure if it's being counted on supernova right now. obv my miner is working, but where's it going???
It's going to take me some time to get organized, but I wanted to try it out first
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:09 PM
I can't help with suprnova, sorry
geebeedeebee 7:09 PM
That's ok. The technical info is helpful as well.

with the verifications, how long does a transaction usually take?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:14 PM
Nobody knows the future price @123, its like stock markets
It takes 100 confirmations before coins can be spent
Oh, do you mean a simple verification? Only a few seconds or less
geebeedeebee 7:16 PM
well, not to be technical, but I remember doing BTC transactions, they would normally take an hour to go through
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:18 PM
Thats one of the reasons Zcash has a larger Block size (2MB I think?)
geebeedeebee 7:18 PM
oh i see, to be quicker?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:19 PM
To hold more information, Bitcoin has been talking about increasing the block size for some time, don't know if they ever did it
123 7:19 PM
Why not develop Windows mining software can run
Now how much the world's arithmetic
geebeedeebee 7:22 PM

mineZcash Admin Owner 7:22 PM
The developers have had to build Zcash from the ground up, they did not have time to also program for Windows
123 7:22 PM
Yes
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:23 PM
Bittrex, Polinex , most big exchanges support Zcash
123 7:23 PM
oh
geebeedeebee 7:23 PM
I used to use Vault Of Satoshi before it closed. Great exchange.
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:24 PM

I would like to be able to log out of my account and then if someone else wants to log in, or if the computer is on idle, have the miner program still running in the background

There are a ton of IM clients available. I spent several weeks working with the developers trying out different platforms. All who tried Rocket thought it was a nice platform to replace Slack while keeping all of the functionality/integrations and reliability so we made the switch. I (and no one else I spoke to) had heard of Riot, previously Vector, just getting out of Beta. Rocket is well known, stable for large scale communities and has a robust development team.

kxra: I know very little about quantum resistance, and yet I have a strong bet that zcash is _not_ quantum resistant.
My understanding of quantum resistance is very rudimentary: "standard asymmetric crypto, such as prime factoring and discrete log problem are vulnerable (I don't understand how) and hash functions properties (eg collision resistance) is not vulnerable."
Can anyone help me refine my understanding? Is my rudimentary heuristic accurate? How can it be more complete?

I'd love to learn more specifically which parts of our construction are- or are not- vulnerable to quantum cryptoanalysis.

@gunhoe yes, according to my naive calculation based on share of hashrate I should have received a payout, but I didn't.

very possibly
i cant see any other way

well , im quite sure that gonna affect the market alot
difficulty too high , centralisation etc etc ..

Hi guys
[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 4:52 PM
Does anyone know a 1 line command to send zcash to a short address like t1PuWRDEE85Uit8kHktbH2HKyT4f3Firr9p with the linux wallet?
[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 4:52 PM
Cli i mean
[OFTC/dannyz2] @rocket.cat Bot 4:55 PM
Hi all
mstg 5:04 PM

or
`zcash-cli z_sendmany from "[{\"address\": \"ADDR\", \"amount\": 1}]"`
[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 5:33 PM
thanks i will try this
[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 5:45 PM
im getting error 28, verifying blocks and rescanning
[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 5:46 PM
sendtoaddress is a address like t1PuWRDEE85Uit8kHktbH2HKyT4f3Firr9p right or is that a command?
[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 5:47 PM
both sendtoaddress and addr in your command are Zcash addresses?

[Slack/davedtt] @rocket.cat Bot 6:06 PM

Looking for feedback here:
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
I can perform the exact same series of steps and achieve the exact same result with *zcoin* (because it too is based on the zerocoin protocol).
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
I can swap some btc for some *zcash* using bitsquare, perform a zcash transaction to break any traceability and sell my zcash (on bitsquare again) and get myself a lovely new btc with no previous history that can be linked to me.
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
Don't give me that 'topological analysis' c**p bacause you can see the amounts, you cannot follow coins around in the zcoin blockchain, it's *impossible* which is why zerocoin was described as perfect money over 3 years ago.
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
The knee jerk reaction I'm expecting is that "it's more anonymous because you cannot see the transaction values" but this is a moot point imo because the whole purpose is to cryptographically break the transaction history which is achieved by both.
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
Isn't it true that the extra lengths zcash goes to is more like 'security theatre', just like when the zcash founders burned the computer which generated the master private keys. Yeah it looked nice but... so what?
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
In summary then, why would someone pay 100x more for an equivalent feature found in another coin? Apart from undetectable fraud and higher resource consumption what does zcash offer over zcoin?
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 7:16 PM
So why then is zcash $70 (down from +2MM)whilst zcoin is $0.70c (down from $10)when the only extra thing zcash seems to offer is undetectable money creation due to the necessity of a trusted setup (which zcoin also had but due to the visibility of the money supply detecting a compromise would be arbitrary)?

@paige: I want to link to specific Q&A's in the FAQ. Is that currently possible, and if so how, and if not can you make it so? 
NOV 20
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 12:00 AM
I've been reading through the benchmarks since and discovered -

```
"On a quad-core benchmark server, generating a private transaction consumes ~3.2 GB of memory and ~50 seconds of compute time."

```

[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 12:00 AM
This is a relatively high memory requirement, as many laptops only have 4GB RAM. Even on a device with 8GB RAM, a 3.2 GB memory requirement may force Zcash's private generation to go into swap space. If Zcash goes into swap, then even on the state of the art SSDs, transfer rates are at least 10 times slower than DDR-3 speeds. On older devices, transfer rates could be 30 times slower or more if Zcash goes to swap. Thus, for a typical 4gb RAM device (which usually already has at least 1gb of memory being used), Zcash's effective compute time should be between 10 minutes to 30 minutes. It is also very possible that many devices with 8GB RAM would go into swap as well, also taking between 10 minutes to 30 minutes to generate a private transaction.

```
In light of the above what are the implications for end users?

```

[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 12:00 AM
I'm using a 4GB core i5 lenovo running ubuntu which I (used to) consider rather high end. 48% of my memory is currently allocated so from what I just read I can't use zcash because I don't have enough RAM, is that right?
[Slack/derrend] @rocket.cat Bot 12:00 AM
For example will there ever be a mobile device app for zcash given the amount of resources it takes to create and broadcast a private transaction? I would imagine a remote server building the transaction for you would be out of the question as I should think it would require access to the private components sending the zero knowledge aspect out the window.

https://people.xiph.org/~greg/confidential_values.txt
There are scenarios where a link can be established between sender and recipient based on the amounts sent. There are ways around it but you'd have to go through some extra trouble.
somefguy 10:10 AM
not sure price argument holds much water since coins are divisible. Both Zcash and Zcoin have been getting cheaper lately. I believe there are forks of both Zcash and Zcoin out there that are even cheaper. Zcash was forked by Zclassic and Komodo and Zcoin was forked as well, Zcoin Dark and Zcrypt. So there are cheaper alternatives to both these coins.
rocket.cat November 19, 2016 7:16 PM
So why then is zcash $70 (down from +2MM)whilst zcoin is $0.70c (down from $10)when the only extra thing zcash seems to offer is undetectable money creation due to the necessity of a trusted setup (which zcoin also had but due to the visibility of the money supply detecting a compromise would be arbitrary)?
somefguy 10:16 AM
Being able to know what the total supply of coins is at any given time is certainly a major advantage, though, since you can always be sure the powers that be don't inflate the money supply overnight and you don't have to trust them on doing the right thing. The more expensive the coins will get, the bigger the incentive to act dishonestly and inflate the money supply so this will be a growing concern.

@jshore if that's the case then I fail to see how this platform has any realistic usability if users are required to purchase high end hardware and potentially wait half an hour to create a single transaction. Not *send* a transaction, *create*. So broadcast and block inclusion is extra time on top of that. This sounds like a gimmick coin imo.

What do you think the value will stabilise at?
eivind 12:33 PM
Market cap isn't going up, so unless that changes, the price will be very low indeed, perhaps similar to Namecoin which is worth 22 cents. I am hoping for better though.
sdmr94 12:36 PM
So does anyone know why it went so high previously
eivind 12:36 PM
That was just because the supply was initially so extremely limited with the slow start.
sdmr94 12:38 PM
So is it worth buying or mining them at the moment
eivind 12:40 PM
I don't think buying is a good idea, and mining is also getting close to unprofitable.
In my experience you can make a dollar a day with a typical GPU now, but you probably spend at least half of that on electricity. So it would take 400 days just to break even.
And that's if the price doesn't continue to drop.
sdmr94 12:45 PM
But what if it was to turn around it is early days right?
Does anyone see a future to this one?

Question... If I clone zcash in my living room and create a billion coins out of thin air, sign a message proving what I've done and post it on social media how could you prove I wasn't using the real zcash blockchain?
mathieu 6:56 PM
ull sign using an address that is not visible on the main blockchain ?
derrend 6:57 PM
@mathieu I'll just send a hidden value transaction to the same address on the real zcash chain then. How would you know?
redrockmining 6:59 PM

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:16 PM
@derrend anyone can construct any message they want and sign it with a key they control. The presence of such a message doesn't prove anything.
So, I'd argue that such a proof is indistinguishable from a fabrication created by cloning zcash in your living room and creating a billion coins there.
But let's assume some specifics about the message. Let's say that you published a transaction that was claimed to create a billion coins out of thin air.
(and were present in an output Note of a JoinSplit)
It would be trivial to determine it wasn't on the real Zcash blockchain, because the JoinSplit would not be anchored to it - it would be anchored to the clone.
Specifically, this anchor: https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/src/primitives/transaction.h#L31

    github.com
    zcash/zcash
    zcash

I'm not super familiar with joinsplits and anchors so I guess I'll just believe you for now ;)

bkolobara 6:08 AM
Zcashd doesn't let me send freshly mined coins to a t-address. I first need to send them to a z-address and afterwards to a public one. I understand the idea behind it to have better anonymity. But my workflow right now is to send it to a z-address and send the same amount again to a t-address. I lose basically out on all anonymity, but I need to pay 2x the fee üòû. Can I compile Zcashd in a way that will allow me to send it directly to a t-address?
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:10 AM
No, if you mine coins they have to be first sent to a z_address. An alternative may be to mine in a pool, then you will receive transparent coins as payout from the pool
Also, you can send directly from the z address to a t address (like an exchange) if thats why you are re-sending to yourself.
Otherwise why not just keep all your coins in a z address all the time?
bkolobara 6:18 AM
I'm running a pool and paying out miners in the coinbase tx. Wallets like Jaxx or exchanges like Poloniex have problems handling this kind of transactions. This makes the experience for our miners not so nice. We are looking for workarounds right now, but this temporarily sending to a z-address is far from being a nice user experience.
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:22 AM
I see, yes the pool operator has a bit more work to do becuase of the z_address. The first step is to ensure anonymity of the network, otherwise everyone could just use t addresses all the time then that would defeat the purpose of Zcash
If users just wanted only transparent transactions they could just use Bitcoin

rm1 6:30 AM

bkolobara 6:38 AM
I understand that the purpose of the step is to ensure anonymity, but what I see over and over again is one amount goes into the z-address and the same amount comes out to a t-address. It is pretty easy to track this transactions. We are just looking away and pretending to do the user a benefit without solving the problem. You can always go further and require the users that they can't have another transaction with the same amount going out. But this complicates more the situation. I still feel that by requiring the extra step we didn't solve the problem. And this black and white view, that the users can just use Bitcoin if they want transparent transactions is not helpful. T-addresses and Z-addresses have their purpose. In this case we could completely remove T-addresses. My point is to give the users a choice and not to do something we think is better for them without the benefit being totally clear.
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:46 AM
Every time you send to a t_address from a z_address the amount can be seen so you are defeating the purpose of the first step. But a better question is why defeat it? Why not just payout to a z_address every time? It seems to me the problem is not with Zcash itself but the exchanges that won't support z_address and users that won't use z_addresses.

bkolobara 6:53 AM
Oh, ok üôÇ I didn't claim there is a problem with Zcash. If users/exchanges strongly prefer to use it in a way, maybe we should just let them and not enforce it. I would be also super happy if everyone would just switch to z-addresses, but right now we see a lot of resistance. And for a pool it's a bit CPU expensive to calculate z-address payouts.
peter_zcash 6:53 AM
in my opinion everything around z addresses still needs to mature
@bkolobara CPU is not an issue, each pool needs to go trough a z address anyway as you are not allowed to spend coinbase transactions directly to t addresses
bkolobara 6:55 AM
We do it differently and pay out directly in the coinbase transaction, but in this case we just pushed the responsibility to the user.
mineZcash Admin Owner 6:55 AM
I understand there are issues and I agree with @peter_zcash that the z_address need to mature. I know that the team is working on them but I don't think they will change the underlying method to only use t_address in the mean time
kopykat 6:56 AM
Has joined the channel.
bkolobara 6:56 AM
And this will also be case with a p2p pool if it shows up. So every miner will need to go the route payout -> z-addres -> t-exchange address
peter_zcash 6:56 AM
the main problem I currenlty see is scaling, once you have a z address with several houndred tx in your wallet you will ultimately run into problems

    üòü 1 

ex. I have a wallet that takes +10 secs to process a single block
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:00 AM
My hope is that in the future all transaction to and from users and to and from exchanges will be in z_addresses, then the concept of a truly anonymous network will be fulfilled

alcapone 4:58 PM
Yes, I've used all the official zcash site methods.

But all of them, on arriving at the configure part

rpcuser
rpcpassword
Gen = 1

In this part nothing happens, repeat what I wrote!
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:59 PM
Are you mining in a pool or solo?
alcapone 5:00 PM

I intend to mine and also in the pool, but I wanted a method to mine alone.
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:00 PM
You dont generate the username or password, you can enter anything you want
rpcusername=alcapone
rpcpassword=thegodfather
Or anything else you like, when mining solo it doesn't matter
alcapone 5:03 PM
But in the official tutorial of the site zcash, in the video is placed:

Rpcuser = username
Rpcpassword = etc
Gen = 1

Then pressing Ctrl + D generates a code and more

@Kay5ive seems 2 be 1 of zcash's forks that target the darknet market
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 2:33 AM
@ae0n that's to be expected in the early days
The ratio of shielded to transparent ZEC will likely be a combination of three factors: what users receive it as, what users want to do with it, and what services support.
The first is biased by pools towards t-addrs at present because of the bugs that we've now fixed; the middle factor (P2P transactions) hasn't really taken off yet; and the last is likely biased towards t-addrs because it's very easy to tweak a Bitcoin service to support t-addrs, whereas z-addrs take actual development effort.

Hi all, I would like to move my Ether out of Coinbase to purchase some Zcach. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to log into my account at https://www.gdax.com/ in over a week. Support is giving me the run around. Has anyone experience similar issues? Is there any legal action I can pursue to get my funds out of there?

mineZcash Admin Owner 4:36 PM
Yes, we have a relay bot from IRC/Freenode that works both ways
midnightmagic 4:36 PM
Huh. I thought the Freenode port was disabled due to trolling (or whatever)

Well...any one have some testnet coins? i need 1, 0.1, 0.001 or any!
Or there is any way to test transactions\receive transactions via rpc.
Or how to create my own network and mine some blocks? For example start daemon with "-dev" like ethereum can
mstg 2:06 AM
@ktoxa you can try `-regtest`. To generate blocks in regtest mode just run `zcash-cli generate AMOUNT_OF_BLOCKS`
replace `AMOUNT_OF_BLOCKS` with how many blocks you want to generate
Ktoxa 2:16 AM
@mstg so i need to start daemon with -regtest and then start cli?
mstg 2:16 AM
yes. `./zcashd -regtest` and also you have to run `zcash-cli` with the `-regtest` flag which I forgot to mention
Ktoxa 2:16 AM
@mstg thx will try
@mstg okay now i get blocks...but how i can have some balance?)
mstg 2:19 AM
generate 200 blocks `zcash-cli -regtest 200` and check your balance with `zcash-cli -regtest getbalance`
Ktoxa 2:22 AM
@mstg yay it works...thank you! And if i want to test transactions and receive them via rpc. I need to send transaction then generate some blocks again?
mstg 2:22 AM
Yes. You have to confirm the transactions by generating new blocks üôÇ

Are there any zcash-enabled "payment processing service providers"? I found wallet providers and exchanges, but haven't found any sites set up to assist merchants to accept zcash, but still get paid in government-backed currencies (ie. USD).

mineZcash Admin Owner 3:56 PM
Does coinbase accept Zcash yet? That may be one way

I've seen a few sites that assist merchants in accepting bitcoin payments (ie. bitpay.com)

One thing I've noticed is how much faster zcash is vs. bitcoin, for confirmations.
6 bitcoin confirmations took about an hour

it's much faster but to balance that exchanges (kraken) require more confirmations - 30 vs 6 for bitcoin

@rob: https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/zcash?msg=DsXFk2kBiYEfyEM9x It is a totally fair question. That answer is, we do not yet know when it will begin.

Hello .. Good evening!
Please could anyone please give me a tutorial tutorial on how to configure zcash in LINUX FEDORA for mining SOLO?
I'm having trouble configuring mkdir ~ / .zcash
Does not allow me to access the root folder at the root
elopio 5:41 PM
@alcapone do you have between the symbols in that command?
it should be mkdir ~/.zcash
just one space, between mkdir and ~
alcapone 5:55 PM
I apologize, but it is this part that is giving error ~ / .zcash / zcash.conf
Permission denied and also in Linux Fedora, I can not access the root folder.
elopio 5:59 PM
@alcapone it seems you are putting a lot of extra spaces in there. In linux, you separate commands from arguments with spaces. What you have in there is a path, so it should be entered without spaces. Like this:
~/.zcash/zcash.conf
alcapone 6:07 PM

Hello everyone! üòÅ
Staff, after many attempts and persistence, I was able to install ZCASH. But, there is still something wrong ....

Start zcash, but it is not mining ... It says that I have to add gen = 1 in zcash.conf
But there is already, and yet it is not working.

It is as follows:
rpcuser = user
rpcpassword = password
gen = 1
Can someone please explain to me why I still can not mince ..?

@alcapone get rid of all the _extra spaces_ in your config file, `gen = 1` should be `gen=1` (no spaces). Do that for all your lines and you should be fine
alcapone 8:58 AM
I finally managed to configure zcash and mine now!
Happy, after so many mistakes, I persisted until I got to where I should be.
Now I will get information about mining, payments and so on.
Thanks to everyone who helped!

Anybody know how to upload attachments to the forum? Or is that not possible?
Hm, according to this, it will have to be configured with a whitelist of extensions: https://meta.discourse.org/t/new-attachments/8609

    meta.discourse.org
    New: Attachments!
    Alongside its awesome image handling, Discourse now supports attachments. You can already try it out on try where you can upload .txt, .csv and .log files. If you want to enable attachments on your instance, you have to update the "authorized_extensions" setting. It's pipe-separated list of all the extensions you want to allow. For example, here's the setting used on try: .jpg|.jpeg|.png|.gif|.txt|.csv|.log. Sidenote: the check is only done on the extension of the file. Checking the act...

new wallet as in new receiving address or an entirely new wallet? If you delete the old one zcash will generate a new, empty one next time you start it
john75077 2:06 PM
is a gtx 960 nvidia strong enough to earn some zcash?

hello
lokko 4:57 PM

Good evening, unfortunately, I see big problems for the stability of the Zec, it is for small miners not profitable Zcash to mine and the high acquisition costs as well as electricity prices, right here in Germany. Also, the founders should concentrate on acceptance points so you can pay with Zcash. You have to co-operate with companies, industry, trade, so the Zec will grow.
roberto.d.sil 5:02 PM
wich one is the best hardware to mine zcash?
lokko 5:02 PM
And remember that the number of miners are small, they should be rewarded !!! Not the big ones who are already swimming in money. What makes the currency when there is no use. There is the key: demand and demand, but to wait until he competes with Bitcoin would be measured! Why should he rise? Not rest but focus on business. Think of my words when you wait and do not drive the trade, it will go down just like any other currency
amd hardware
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:02 PM
I agree that we need to have more ways for ZEC to be spent and used in more places like Bitcoin. I think they will come eventually, but this is only the first month. It has taken many years for bitcoin to be so widely adopted
john75077 5:03 PM
will zec have PoS?
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:03 PM
No
roberto.d.sil 5:04 PM
do you guys think zcash price will go up?
john75077 5:05 PM
i think it will
lokko 5:05 PM
It is clear to me that we are in the first month, but I am about how to bring the zcash to where he belongs, in the long term
üòÄ
john75077 5:05 PM
I am glad that Im able to get into a what seems to be a good clean launch and I can hold onto coin to help the value go up
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:05 PM
I don't speculate on price, but with such a new currency the only driver of the price for now is the mining costs and speculators, as you mentioned we need more real world applications
lokko 5:05 PM
yes
john75077 5:07 PM
I dont know the difficulty involved, though i would think a good facebook game or some other media function would do well
lokko 5:08 PM
Indeed, the price increases with demand, and that is the key to success, that is to say, trade
roberto.d.sil 5:08 PM
need to create more demand
lu.pa 5:10 PM
Hi all... I tried to make a z_address transaction via bitsquare but couldn't... they say:
"hi, u used a z address, which cannot be verified by the arbitrator in case of a dispute. please use only the transparent addresses (t) as only those can be verified. please delete your zec account and set up a new one with a t address. i will close the case and both get back their btc."
lokko 5:11 PM
As I said, I see a huge problem in that the little miners are not rewarded too much !! And they are in the multitude, because something must happen!
john75077 5:12 PM
Maybe there needs to be some services connected to the bitcoin api to make services
zcash has made it to shapshift.io when is good i think. why cant that be leveraged somehow?
which*
lokko 5:14 PM
Do not forget, there are enough currencies and there are always new additions, which should be reason enough not to stop working the success of the zec
mineZcash Admin Owner 5:15 PM
It depends on the application I suppose, shapeshift is great from one crypto to another, but many online vendors want quick and easy conversion to fiat/cash
The Developers are still working every day on Zcash
john75077 5:17 PM
Perhaps later on there will be android / ios game that takes zcash
lokko 5:18 PM
No, the problem is that the price is not stable, this can only stabilize if supply and demand exist, it is like a big chain with limbs, missing one is it no chain more.
john75077 5:19 PM
Well, so far from everything i have been able to read it seems like it has a future which is why im mining it and ill hold on to it

I want to say quite clearly something, it is now so all that the state is not deserved to be classified as illegal, and the success will lie in this, that the state is not so much because anonymously deserve it. I hope the billions of transactions are settled about it. There will be success, I will say it as it is
I pfeiffe on the state which is the most illegal and criminal organization and that sold as legal
whistless
Sorry, but I had to say the times, the worst sit at the very top exactly so I hope the zec will get through
lokko 6:01 PM

ah okay i wasn't aware. so.. no. then claymore gets it all, i believe it also was faster all the time
and more stable
jm9k 12:51 AM
All my rigs are still running Silentarmy on Ubuntu. I didn't realize the developer gave up and I stopped watching. The Claymore miner more than doubled the speed. Pretty impressive.
ocminer 1:01 AM
but claymore is windows only, right ?
jm9k 1:02 AM
Yes, it appears to be. Some forum posts indicate it will be ported to Linux eventually, but right now it says "There are builds for Windows x64 only. No Linux. No 32-bit support. No NVidia support."
ocminer 1:03 AM
yup üòû
jm9k 1:03 AM
This is a bummer. I've only mined on Linux since 2011.
ocminer 1:03 AM
same here.. but claymore is doing a great job ... he's a windows fanboy though üôÇ
jm9k 1:04 AM
I've been talking with some people who are interested in building out a small mining farm. I would need to administrate it remotely 99% of the time. I don't know how to do this properly on Windows.
If I have to RDP into each one that would be a horrible pain in the ass each time there was an upgrade.
ocminer 1:10 AM
i beliebe RDP is the only way for windows.. yes.. well claymore probably doesn't really care because his "farm" is managed by the miners üôÇ
windows is a nightmare for remote control etc, i agree
but still most people use it.. also miners
i see about 80% of the rigs on my pool are claymore&windows
jm9k 1:10 AM
I know there is some mass config tools for Windows, I just never use it.
ocminer 1:11 AM
with linux you can just ssh into a rig, reboot or restart it.. give it another job, other settings etc.. without even touching a mouse
do that on windows üòõ
jm9k 1:13 AM
I know, I have my rigs all setup that way. Restart and reboot all also all automated.
Do you have any OS statistics from your pool prior to the Claymore miner release? I'm just wondering if there was a big shift.
ocminer 1:15 AM
it was all mixed before
but with every claymore version more and more migrated to claymore
also linux vanished of course because of that.. seems we're a few guys left on linux üôÇ
silentarmy and optiminer was used pretty well before
and of course still nheqminer for cpu's
but it's hopeless to mine with cpu now with latest claymore
at the current time 83% of the workers on the pool are claymore
jm9k 1:18 AM

you guys payout about 1/2 what we pay
sometimes even only 1/3
jm9k 2:42 AM

ocminer 2:42 AM
in switzerland you pay like 0.35$ per kW/h
jm9k 2:42 AM
Wow, that sucks.
ocminer 2:42 AM
i'd be dreaming about that price üôÇ
jm9k 2:45 AM
The investors I work with offered me a dedicated location in Las Vegas, NV to build a small farm. Commercial power costs are 8.43¬¢/kWh there.
I'm not sure that's the best location though. Even though the location is rent free (since they own it already), the air conditioning costs would be murder in the summer. It gets to about 120F there. (Almost 50C.)
lokko 2:46 AM
0.22 Euro/Cent thats sucks

That's 0.23USD. Yes, that is terrible also.

I think I stopped mining in 2012 after I left my job. Then MtGox collapsed and I lost everything.
I stopped watching it for a couple years, then I heard about Ethereum and I started up again.

i've made a killing ETH too, mined it right after launch where no pools etc where up
thank god I sold it all pretty early

So essentially, JoinSplit transfer is a transaction and JoinSplit description is the means of input and output of ZECs?
belbox 5:11 AM
A JoinSplit description is data included in a transaction that describes a JoinSplit operation, i.e. a confidential value
transfer.
you can read about it at 8 page: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4363/fc884880a826aa64a65aa15de9f7c07f458e.pdf
pavel.tarasov 5:12 AM
I have, that why im asking
its not really clear to me what is meant by data
belbox 5:14 AM
JoinSplit description consists 10 fields
pavel.tarasov 5:15 AM
So the JoinSplit transfer and JoinSplit operation are teh same thing?
belbox 5:16 AM
transfer - transaction?
operation in transaction
pavel.tarasov 5:17 AM
And JoinSplit descriptions are used for input and output from different entities, of which there can be several descriptions per transfer/operation..is my understanding correct?
rob 5:17 AM
is there a way to do a transaction that hides the amounts yet?
pavel.tarasov 5:17 AM
See one paper mentions JoinSplit Transfer, and this one mentions operations
There are essentially two papers with different naming conventions
rob 5:20 AM
wait so joinspit doesn't hide the amounts?
pavel.tarasov 5:21 AM
that wasnt the answer to your question
i think the answer to your question is it hides the ammounts if you send from z address to z address
have a read here
https://z.cash/blog/anatomy-of-zcash.html

    z.cash
    Zcash - Anatomy of A Zcash Transaction

rob 5:22 AM
@zooko it seems like the amounts are still transparent?
"TODO: They also have a transparent value
flow that interacts with the JoinSplit description‚Äôs v
old
pub and v
new
pub . Inputs and outputs are associated with a value."
yes but if you read the paper, it says it has a transparent value flow
pavel.tarasov 5:23 AM
yes Ive read the paper, and it explains why it has the transparent value flow üòâ
rob 5:23 AM
why does it?
i thought the whole point was for transactions to be hidden
the amounts
pavel.tarasov 5:24 AM
did you look at the link i sent you? üôÇ
its high level but seems to make sense, to me anyway
as far as i understand there is a way to do both
rob 5:26 AM
it appears it is false advertising, and it can only do transparent amounts.
it appears they are lying about it
"A JoinSplit operation spends Nold notes n
old
1..Nold and transparent input v
old
pub, and creates Nnew notes n
new
1..Nnew and
transparent output v
new
pub .
pavel.tarasov 5:28 AM
heh, the above statement makes sense to me anyway, as it talks about both transparent and shielded values.
rob 5:37 AM
where have they confirmed that the current code can do shielded values?
pavel.tarasov 5:46 AM
ask them and see what they say. The paper claims it does, says nothing about the code, you asked how does it deal with hidden/transparent values and i told you.

If a sender sends a ZEC from z address to t address, everyone can see the details of the transactoin but the sender remains anonymous? How can the sender view that transaction on the blockchain? simply by searchin gor the ephemeral key comes into play?

You are currently not mining.
To enable mining, add 'gen=1' to your zcash.conf and restart.

Since starting this node 19 hours, 14 minutes, 33 seconds ago:
- You have validated 3732 transactions!
seem like when I first started it I went from 30% to 60% sync'd in like 30 minutes and then it got stuck
also, I thought I validated like 100k txs in a few minutes at first
jm9k 5:14 PM
It could be related to network problems, and probably just bugs in zcashd.
skyl 5:16 PM
maybe I should compile from source instead of using the .deb's
?
jm9k 5:17 PM
Make sure you're using the latest version: v1.03. You could also try the source next. I kind of doubt that would be different than the deb though.
Last resort is you could just manually copy a synced blockchain from a different machine.

bitcartel 9:41 AM
@skyl Can you do a `zcash-cli stop` on your current node, then backup the `.zcash` folder --> `.zcash.backup` and then move the old copy (before the reind) of the `.zcash` back into place, and launch `zcashd` again and let it sync upto the current block. It should then show the correct baalance. This is to see if you needed to reindex or not (maybe you did after doing all that stuff and if zcashd ever crashed during that time).

Private blockchains for enterprise businesses is going to be huge eventually. Right now we are just seeing the infancy though. I think it's really too early to tell how it's really going to be adopted.

I see one of the biggest potential uses for smart contract typed systems as being for insurance. However, I don't see it as the God send that all the hypesters think it will be. Insurance will still be reliant on people, and people make lots of mistakes, even if the blockchain tech they are using is flawless.

What is with ethereum's unlimited supply tho? And, it is so focused on developers ... idk ...

jm9k 12:03 AM
The possibility of business services being built completely on the blockchain is fascinating though. I was talking with Fred Ehrsam, the Coinbase CEO, about this topic. He believes services like Uber could eventually be turned into a blockchain application that doesn't even require a business to back it anymore. That's still a ways away though.
I don't see Ethereum's unlimited supply as an issue really. It's just slow inflation and a negligible amount.
I was originally strongly in support for the deflationary currency ideology, but I'm largely indifferent now. First off, Bitcoin is deflationary today, but that doesn't mean it will be forever. Eventually the mining rewards will stop, and after that we don't really know what will happen. The transaction fees might go up, or the mining system might fall apart. In the latter case, the core developers would likely switch it to an unlimited supply. If they didn't do it, the miners might just revolt and fork it themselves.

eth vs etc ... I started paying closer attention just at a time when Ethereum was looking wobbly, I guess

Secondly, Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. In a sense, it's already unlimited in supply.

can it be divided smaller than a Satoshi?
jm9k 12:08 AM
I think ETC is kind of a joke. I can't believe it's gotten so much support.

A Satoshi is just the current smallest unit. Bitcoin is, in theory, infinitely divisible. They've stated that many times.
skyl 12:11 AM
oh, okay
jm9k 12:13 AM
I consider gold to be true currency. If you compare Bitcoin to gold, they are both finite in supply, but gold is not infinitely divisible. Gold can also be lost, but then found again. If you lose your Bitcoin wallet it's gone forever. It's like you took your pot of gold and shot it off into space at the speed of light.
And people have lost their wallets many, many times.
Even Mtgox temporarily misplaced a wallet with something like 180000 BTC in it.

If you have your gold in a bank, and the bank burns down, the gold is still there. Maybe it's melted, but it's still there. If your computer crashes, and you don't have a wallet backup, that's game over.
nat 12:28 AM

    Zcash Forum
    Zcash Forum is the official Zcash community message board.

I find the forum quite impenetrable.
With chats, like this one, and with twitter, and with Slack, I have a way to use it that I really like: I select which channels I'm going to watch and which ones I'm going to ignore, and then I read _all_ of the content in the channels I'm watching, in chronological order.
I cannot figure out how to do that with the forum, and it is really frustrating. I kind of hate looking at it, because every time I do I feel this pain "Aigh! There are potentially important conversations in here that I missed, and I have not way to detect them and find them and catch up! And there are all these conversations in front of my face that I don't want to see!"

Matrix seems more "chat" , than a "forum" to me. I think the key with any page that has a large amount of users/topics is being able to filter the topics you don't care to visit. Even when selecting a category Discourse always wants to put every post in every category on the front page. This takes the extra step of you clicking on the filters to restrict what you see to a single category at a time

@zooko, the forum has categories which you can hide from main view or dive into individually.

    What I mean is - I'm new to the crypto currency scene. And am not much of a techie, even though I am somehow the IT manager at a very small business. I find Bitcoin ‚Äúcool‚Äù but something about Zcash speaks to my soul. That was an intentional rhyme. However, when I read tweets (with my very little knowledge about code) like this Now that #Steemit / #Steem #Scam is obvious as price drifts to 0, it's time to update "Mt.

nat 3:54 PM
why did people move away from slack?
(just curious)
jm9k 3:56 PM
I still use Slack for private business related projects. It doesn't work as well for open community chat though.
nathan Electric Coin Company 4:28 PM
Where can I learn how to embed data with OP_RETURN? I want to learn about both how to do it with the RPC interface and also what the transaction format is.
nathan Electric Coin Company 4:45 PM
nat: we had a couple of motivations: we wanted to preserve chat history without paying a large fee (the main reason) and we were also hitting user limits with slack. Also, we wanted a community run service, and like using open source software.
nat 5:48 PM
right on
I'm still struggling with slack as a better option than IRC. The best reason (and, I guess this is good) is that it dovetails better with linked media formats and provides some better functionality.
[best that I heard, I guess]
So I guess in a modern environment I can see the appeal of being nimble and capable like that, but the trade off with having centralized comm network seems dubious. Anyway, this is probably like <1% as important as other considerations you have to think about! üòâ
nathan Electric Coin Company 6:10 PM
No, nat, I hear you. I feel like the centralization is a big drawback.
There're a bunch of UX tweaks that are nice. I especially like linking to specific comments.
A lot of those benefits are _possible_ with IRC + surrounding tools, but it's a pain to get it all set up well enough.
nat 6:27 PM
hm yeah, interesting. Thank you for weighing in!
jm9k 8:08 PM
I've wondered if decentralized chat based on blockchain tech would work. You can probably do most of it with Ethereum now, but it wouldn't work well. In addition to the obvious UX problems, I think many people would be very hesitant to pay the gas fees involved with chatting.

Hello, does zcashd perform any operations on shutdown? Does it trap SIGTERM and will it cause problems if it's SIGKILL-ed?
More specifically would that cause re-scanning the next time it's started?
zab 9:43 AM
I am suspecting that the Swing wallet is not shutting down zcashd correctly. Here is the sequence of steps:
1. execute "zcash-cli stop", wait for that process to end
2. wait for one second for the "zcashd" process to end
3. if that doesn't happen, SIGKILL
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 1:24 PM
@zab signal trapping is unchanged from Bitcoin 0.11.2
At the very least, SIGINT is handled correctly (because that's what I use to shut it down)
But that is usually a foreground signal, so I would expect that SIGTERM would be the correct way to end the daemon.
5thdimension 8:12 PM
@zab worst case use killall -15 zcashd
if it complain for acces error use -9

Looking to get some RX 400 series GPU's can anyone please tell me speeds of 470 vs 480 ? Thank you

binkersoft 1:17 AM
Thank you. So they are both pretty close
jm9k 1:17 AM
All three are different brands. I think there might be a slight clockspeed difference on the two RX 480s.
binkersoft 1:18 AM
But they are close enough that if I find a good price on 470's it will work out.
jm9k 1:18 AM
An RX480 should be about 12.5% faster than an RX470.
Definitely close enough if you find a good price.
I've seen the RX 480 at about $180 USD with mail-in rebate.

Once I got it the receipt was in the box. It shipped brand new from Nespresso.com, and the amount paid was $450.
But I paid $350 on eBay.
binkersoft 1:25 AM
nice find
jm9k 1:25 AM
I figure someone used a stolen credit card.
They sold dozens of them.
What is interesting is the way it was handled though.
Everyone was covered by the eBay buyer protection. So what eBay did was just silently delete all traces of the sale from their system.
I figure they just ate the cost and tried to sweep it under the carpet.
binkersoft 1:27 AM

binkersoft 1:34 AM

bedaxen 11:22 AM
Is it that the miners' systems are being infected by the miner software they downloaded or is it just that there are plenty of systems on the internet that happen to be infected with malware (gotten who knows how) that is mining covertly for some group
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:23 AM
Probably both, many malware hackers add thier software to legitimate looking software, and since so many are downloading miners for GPU, which Zcash does not officially support, there are some exploiting
bedaxen 11:25 AM
so the reports of systems being infected to mine zcash illegitimately has no correlation with the systems of people who are mining zcash consciously
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:26 AM
https://securelist.com/blog/research/76862/zcash-or-the-return-of-malicious-miners/

    securelist.com
    Zcash, or the return of malicious miners
    On 28 October, the cryptocurrency world saw the emergence of a new player, the Zcash (ZEC) cryptocurrency. Its developers have described it rather figuratively: "If Bitcoin is like HTTP for money, Zcash is HTTPS." They continue by noting that "unlike Bitcoin, Zcash transactions can be shielded to hide the sender, the recipient and value of all transactions."

That article goes more in depth with the findings
bedaxen 11:29 AM
sounds like FUD
just because someone has mining software on their system doesn't automatically mean that they consciously downloaded infected mining software
I *do* agree with your sentiment, in general. people should always be careful about the security of their systems and their downloads
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:32 AM
True, but someone who downloaded a miner from an unknown resource should make sure it's safe
bedaxen 11:33 AM
while that may be true for any software, in general, it's much more likely that someone who wanted to illegitimately mine a cryptocurrency would target *any* vulnerable system
which would have nothing to do with a conscious download of mining software. Hence, FUD
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:35 AM
I dont see the correlation. The article says that you need to be careful when downloading a miner from the Internet. Not that all miners contain viruses.
bedaxen 11:37 AM
"To prevent the installation of mining programs, Kaspersky Lab users should check their security products and make sure detection of unwanted software is enabled."
to me, that addresses people who have vulnerable systems that have no interest in zcash whatsoever
this seems to have very little to do with infected mining software consciously downloaded for the conscious purpose of mining zcash and everything to do with mining software as a malicious payload infecting vulnerable systems of people who have no interest in mining zcash
downloading mining software in and of itself shouldn't therefore be considered as an enhanced risk, whatsoever
emphasis on "enhanced"
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:41 AM
Hm, I see your point about the article. It is main addressing the user being unaware of the software, but that does not give anyone who downloads a miner the luxury of not doing thier own due diligence
bedaxen 11:42 AM
and the article doesn't seem to address the conscious downloading of mining software, per se
I agree, in general, about due diligence about system and download security
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:42 AM
I see your point
bedaxen 11:44 AM
Thanks
Didn't mean to pick a nit, but i just saw a bit of a blur between two separate issues
I want people to mine as much zcash as quickly as possible... just *legitimately*... *and* yes, user due diligence is super important in every case (including legitimate miners)
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:50 AM
I do see that there is a difference between the two, but I just took the article to add a PSA for the many versions of miners being downloaded. There were already a few that popped up on the forums that had to be romoved. That was back closer to launch when they were trying to take advantage of the frenzy of people starting to mine.
bedaxen 11:51 AM
isn't having many different types of mining software a good thing?
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:51 AM
But as always with any software, better safe than sorry üôÇ
Yes, the more the merrier
I'm not discouraging the user of other miners in any way
As the old saying goes "trust but verify"
bedaxen 11:55 AM
Personally, I see the world spending an inordinate amount of time innovating, at the expense of security

mineZcash Admin Owner 11:57 AM
Sometimes people are in a rush for the next big thing and gloss over the details
bedaxen 11:58 AM
While I am the biggest fan of being constructive and the biggest enemy of being destructive, at this point, honestly... I think it's time for the general public to get as hacked as severely as their vulnerabilities allow
it's the only way things will improve, from a security standpoint
and a privacy standpoint... and an anonymity standpoint
and a secrecy standpoint
lol

I remember in the early days of Bitcoin there were lots of campaigns to drive adoption by issuing donations, but only if accepted in Bitcoin. Anything like that going on with Zcash?
xiahong.lin 11:13 PM
can anyone give me a guide to export a zcash private key? I worry what I exported is not enough to re-import in the future.
jm9k 12:30 AM
@xiahong.lin I don't have a guide for Zcash, however you might be able to use the same instructions as Bitcoin. Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin, and many aspects are the same.
xiahong.lin 1:57 AM
@jm9k I agree, however, it comes with t-address and z-address, are these two share the same private key, or come with different keys?
jm9k 2:00 AM
@xiahong.lin I don't have a definitive answer on that one.
xiahong.lin 2:00 AM
Also, why https://explorer.z.cash is redirected to testnet https://explorer.testnet.z.cash/, is zcash still in testnet stage? I do find some non-testnet explorer https://explorer.zcha.in/

What's the deal with the founders reward coins? I thought they were being distributed at the beginning of the month but they still haven't moved.
jm9k 2:29 PM
@t.t. That depends on if the pool has a fee or not. In most cases there is a fee, so yes, solo is more profitable by a very small percentage.

Anyone is interested in building some fun project on top of zcash? I think zcash needs to have a eco-system to survive
jm9k 1:17 AM
@xiahong.lin Absolutely Zcash needs adoption to survive. If you have good project ideas I'd like to hear them.
jeewaka 1:24 AM
I think the investors and the Zcash team that needs to push the adoption of it and a bit of future plans , per transparency
jm9k 1:31 AM
@jeewaka The Zcash team did a great job hyping it. The actual release was less impressive. Now that it's out, what do you do with it? No one accepts it. There is no infrastructure. That's what is really holding it back.
I don't even know if it's being used for illegal stuff yet.
Anyone know if there is a live Silk Road anywhere?
I'd be curious to know if they accept Zcash yet, or just Bitcoin?
jm9k 2:21 AM
I checked around in some darknet stuff I found on Reddit. I see Bitcoin on all places, Monero on a few others. Didn't see any others listed.
xiahong.lin 2:28 AM
one unique thing is zcash is probably the 3rd most exchange-listed currency
I am still brain-storming potential ideas
jm9k 2:44 AM
I don't really see Zcash as opening any fascinating new opportunities. It's really just an improved version of Bitcoin, so it does all the same stuff as Bitcoin.
I think Ethereum has a lot more potential, but it's still a bit early. The infrastructure to build serious applications just isn't there yet.
snookie 3:24 AM
@jm9k but Ether will go POS in February...
jm9k 3:32 AM
@snookie There is no way Ethereum is going POS in February. It's going to be a while.
snookie 3:34 AM
@jm9k let us see...
jm9k 3:34 AM
I'd put money on that. Unfortunately Augur.net is still a POS.
The other kind of POS.
One interesting thing is that could happen is if Ethereum goes POS, the miners might do a POW fork.
capataz 3:39 AM
POW fork? how is that?asuming that eth classic is still POW?
jm9k 3:49 AM
I'm just saying there is nothing to stop another fork, regardless of what ETC does.

veikko.eeva 10:10 AM
@xiahong.lin It looks to me there are fitting application to be built on ZEC, but it takes a while for them to take off.
jeewaka 10:53 AM
Zcash is only trying to find its floor before people can accept it, I am sure a lot of folks don't even way to trade with it as its just dipping down consistently. The Slow start with the hype and then now the distribution of the Founders Reward to be released anytime soon causes mass dumping by miners. There is no roadmap for big features for zcash.
snookie 11:43 AM
and what we will say about Ethereum ...
veikko.eeva 12:20 PM
Hmm, does anyone have ideas about that selective revealing? I could imagine some attribute-based encryption scheme.
My little brother is mining ZCash, I'd too but I've been too busy to set up a rig with my n00b Linux skills. üôÇ
@jm9k I have ideas, but this is more like telling there are ideas and someone, namely we, are considering using ZChain as a part of it. In same sense as written at http://www.multichain.com/blog/2016/11/understanding-zero-knowledge-blockchains/.
I see there's an attempt to switch over to CMake. I've contemplating a (native) Windows build, which would likely helped a lot if the build system were CMake.
jm9k 12:33 PM

@radix42 I'll check tomorrow. It's midnight here and my brains are toast. üôÇ In reality I don't have much time to put into this, but at least I can see what's up and if I have ideas.
@radix42 With a very quick glimpse, is there an abstraction layer on top of Posix? The ongoing work to transition to CMake looks very worthawhile due to https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/vcblog/2016/11/16/cmake-support-in-visual-studio-the-visual-studio-2017-rc-update/, but that doesn't help that much if there's a lot of platform dependent code there. There's also https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/install_guide.
@radix42 I was looking at the recent discussion at https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/libsnark. Maybe I'm mistaken?

    chat.zcashcommunity.com
    Zcash Community

In that it's only that one library.
veikko.eeva 3:12 PM
Having CMake would allow more Windows people to come in, and set up, say, Appveyor or something to build and run tests on Windows to catch problems easier. I'm looking ath the list at https://github.com/scipr-lab/libsnark/tree/cmake and wonder if timers could use `std::chrono` and `std:random` for instance. I think internally they call to either `/dev/random` or `/dev/urandom`.

    github.com
    scipr-lab/libsnark
    libsnark - C++ library for zkSNARKs

There's an interestin issue about entropy that one can run out on Linux, but somehow I haven't found such a situation in Windows (i.e. a distinction between `/dev/urandom` and pseudorandomness).
Hmm, looking at the issues about endianess and 32-bit an 64-bit code, I wonder how much of http://www.viva64.com/en/a/0050/ would apply, say. :

Hmm, firewall blocked `a.exe`.

@catman those pool guys and miners are part of the community it is normal to pay a little to them because they do what they do best if fees are higher or people try to hide fees from you them stay away ....I will never cut the hand of the man that feeds me!!
cryptillian 5:34 PM
catman 2,5 fee thats nothing for what he did for mining z . some pools have fees like that

@mineZcash getlocalsolps was added in 1.0.4, it returns the same value that would be seen on the metrics screen
So a value of 0.00000000 means the zcashd node isn't mining (either not turned on, or can't reach peers)

And you can fund with a credit card.
jeewaka 8:31 PM
ZEC jumped almost 10% in an hour or less
whats the news?
why would you buy gold when the 2 biggest markets for gold are moving to btc in india and china?
better to buy ZEC i think since last week
jm9k 8:38 PM
Because gold is real money. Cryptocurrency is experimental currency.
I also buy physical silver.
In the less than likely event of a dollar collapse or zombie apocalypse, metals may be the only universal medium of exchange.

jm9k 9:09 PM
If everyone is too impoverished to have a smartphone, or the in the zombie case, the internet is severely broken, then cryptocurrency isn't going to do much good.
Someday I also want an emergency bunker that is fully stocked, located in Montana or something. I don't have nearly enough money for that yet though.
If we all become Zcash millionaires, that's one of the things I'm building.
jeewaka 9:22 PM
@jm9k so you live in a bubble in the west? do you know about MPESA?
you doomsday scenerio is wrong, because you can't even access any type of fiat.
jm9k 9:24 PM
Never heard of Mpesa. A third world mobile phone based Paypal? Not that surprising.
How would my doomsday scenario be wrong? Physical metal is not fiat.
jeewaka 11:06 PM
paypal? the whole population uses it, its the real world practical use of a virtual currency
how are you going to break down that metal to pay?
jm9k 12:06 AM
The question you should be asking is: how are you going to use virtual currency if there is no electricity or internet?
skyl 12:07 AM
have to launch our own satellites and have some decentralized electricity
jm9k 12:08 AM
In the doomsday scenario, bartering would be big. Silver and gold coins of different sizes can be used as currency. Old USA dimes are great because they are mostly silver. You can buy bags of them sold as "junk silver".

tromer Zcash Foundation 8:41 AM
@alexander, from your experience how reliable is Trezor in handling ZEC?
alexander 11:10 AM
@tromer trezor has a problem with sending ZEC at the moment. "Failed to send transaction.
Error details: Failed to compile output"
SatoshiLabs don't know if it is a problem with the Waterhole.io backend server or in their configuration because sending transactions was fine until some time.
After the new year, there should be their own backend active.

hi @Debbietop what OS do you use?
hi @trenton.oudelerk ask away

I am using Ubuntu 16.4 and have been struggling to get zCash mining setup. There is a lot of information to take in and I'm not sure which pieces of it I should be using. Could you point me to a good website that explains in detail step by step what is needed to be done for mining to occur?
vanilla1226 11:39 PM
You probably want to download a miner, and there are different ones for CPU and GPU mining, and even further split between AMD and Nvidia cards.
Check out zec.suprnova.cc the help section, getting started. Lists out a bunch of different miners you can choose. Or search the miner category on the forums
Unless you are able to produce a high hashrate, you will want to join a mining pool as well. Suprnova is a good one, I'm using Flypool currently, but there are a lot to choose from

@seven No problem to ask, that was the preliminary C++ port to Windows by @radix42. I have had problems to gearing back to "work". Somehow I didn't quite register the Christmas time, kids, relatives etc. and found it's difficult to get back to something more productive. üòÉ
I have a bazillion browsers open (Edge, FF and Chrome) and a gazillion tabs in every and each of them. I think I throw most of them overboard...

I'm interested in how newbies can Mine Zcash without any IT Developer knowledge? Are there any systems out there to Mine with smart devices? Also how much Hashing Power would I need to Mine "1" Zcash a day?
jm9k 12:59 AM
@crypto.world You don't need to be a full developer to mine. Mining is just software you run. No, you cannot mine with smart devices because they are not powerful enough. At the current hashrate of 50.07MH/s, you would need 8693 H/s, which is approximately 38 RX 480 GPUs.

    Technical AMA w/ Zcash core devs Dec 22nd noon PST
    I have been watching this AMA from the start as a silent observer and thought I break the silence now. Being a mining service provider we find it incredibly encouraging to read from the minds behind Zcash. We feel this is the main reason Zcash will take over the cryptocurrency market. You simply have the strongest team. I have one question. Do you believe there will be a way to secure assets in the Zcash Blockchain, perhaps through something like two-factor authentication? This might go hand-...

@skyl am a newbie in all this, just watch and learning how to start from somewhere. Hope I will learn fast. Thanks

@jm9k Something I've felt is odd in the apocalypse movies is that people scavenge cities and try to find safe-havens. Here people have mostly dispersed into wilderness to "hiding cottages" (piilopirtti in Finnish), this is probably comparable to have a hideout in Montana. üôÇ

Plenty, plenty of linker erros, I must say. It is likely the CMake port guy faces the same problems.
It looks like the dependencies aren't stated explicitly, but are transitive.
Plenty of libsnark errors currently, phew!

Anybody solo mining? Whats your Sols / s if you are solo mining?
vanilla1226 10:20 PM
I think you have to be above 10k sol/s to have a small chance of finding a valid block solo. But it might take you weeks
