    PR: ZPool Launches ZCash Mining Pool - Bitcoin News
    2019.1.1, one of the world‚Äôs largest ZCash mines‚ÄîZPool officially opened up its ZCash mining pool, and started recruiting miners from all over the world free of service charges. KIENG KESSARA, the founder of ZPool, noted that, ZPool was formerly known as Megabigpower Bitcoin mine, which was built in September 2017 in Idaho, the United States. It now only serves ZCash, a digital currency. ZCash is an encrypted currency that realized complete privacy protection by using the zero-knowledge proof (zk-SNARKS). For individuals, privacy is a rigid demand; enterprises, on the other hand, propose more demanding requirements for privacy protection in the block chain. Therefore, privacy protection is one of the most important and the most difficult directions of the technical pursuit related to block chain. In addition, through totaling 21 million, ZCash only had about 5.5 million circulating in the market‚Äîhigh rarity. With respect to investment, ZCash is the most valuable digital currency; moreover, compared with BTC and ETH, it boasts less difficult to compute power and higher return.2019.1.1, one of the world‚Äôs largest ZCash mines‚ÄîZPool officially opened up its ZCash mining pool, and started recruiting miners from all over the world free of service charges.KIENG KESSARA, the founder of ZPool, noted that, ZPool was formerly known as Megabigpower Bitcoin mine, which was built in September 2017 in Idaho, the United States.

Guys, please, help. I'm diving into privacy issues of zksnarks. The main question what your understanding of anon–Ωmity is about? What are your privacy guaranties?

    What are zk-SNARKs? | Zcash
    zk-SNARKs are a novel form of zero-knowledge cryptography which allow for private Zcash transactions. These transactions can be fully encrypted on the blockchain, yet still be verified by zK-SNARKs as valid under the network‚Äôs consensus rules.

dmitrynvm 5:40 AM
Thank you, very good articles! I've read them and also the description from official site available in pdf. I'm good enough in math to get through their contents, but some strange feeling does not leaving me due to the lack of concrete examples. Let's consider a simple example. I to by some pizza in a restaurant and want to know exactly what information is being hidden by zksnark? Nobody will able to get information about
1. client address,
2. details of order,
3. restaurant adress.
Zero-knowledge proof is used to determine the degree of transaction validity?

mineZcash Admin Owner 5:47 PM
@dmitrynvm yes, basically the zkSNARK proves that the transaction was valid but doesn't reveal anything about you. So in your example if you bought a pizza, and paid with a private transaction the Pizza shop owner would not be able to see any other transactions that you have made with that private address
which is quite different than if you bought that Pizza with Bitcoin. The Pizza shop owner could look up your address on any block explorer and see what that address has been doing.

Hey, technically speaking in the Zcash code, do the Notes (aka the 'Anon Coins' to give context for my question) count as a second currency? Or are Notes just a different version of the Non-Anon (unshielded) coin?
Also, does Zcash have the same scripting language it inherited from Bitcoin? Or did that get removed?
paige Admin Moderator 3:43 AM
@quantafire Same currency. Think of ZEC passing into and out of a shielded pool when being spent to a shielded address and back out to a transparent address.

@quantafire Same scripting as of Bitcoin 0.11.2 plus anything more recent that's been cherry-picked to also add into Zcash. Don't think anything was explicitly removed or disabled but not 100% sure on that.

Normal bitcoin stuff but for transparent addresses - scripting doesn't apply to shielded.
quantafire 11:48 AM
@paige I see, cool
Would there be any advantage to Zcash using the account model instead of the utxo model other than maybe reduced size to hold utxo set since outputs to the same address would be combined?

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:03 PM
Yes the account model has significant efficiency advantages
You don't have the cost of combining UTXOs; there's no need for change; and there are no "dust" UTXOs
The use of the UTXO model in Zcash is more of a historical accident than a requirement
quantafire 10:01 PM
@daira Right
Are there any disadvantages?
And how how hard would it be for zcash to switch over to an account model? Since it would allow application of Coda's work on succinct bockchains. Or maybe it would be easier to translate succinct chains to the utxo model than change zcash to an account model
daira January 14, 2019 5:06 PM
The use of the UTXO model in Zcash is more of a historical accident than a requirement
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:28 AM
We would probably switch to an account model at the same time as doing succinct blockchains
(We haven't committed to doing that, and there are some unsolved problems, but I don't think switching to an account model would be the difficult part.)
There's an obvious way to do the switch while maintaining compatibility: treat each UTXO as an account
I'm not aware of any significant disadvantages of the account model, in a fully shielded context
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:44 AM
Note that in order to be a strict improvement, the account-based protocol has to support multiple parallel transfers from an account, so that you don't have to wait for one transfer to be mined before sending the next
I'm not sure the naive protocol in the Coda whitepaper supported this, but it's quite feasible
zooko Electric Coin Company 8:48 AM
Folks, I've been canvassing various kinds of people about What's Most Important for Zcash, as I do continuously. Most recently it was a set of cryptographers (at Real World Crypto) and a set of investors (VCs / Coin Funds). My practice is that I listen carefully to people that I respect (who are numerous) and to random people I've just met, more than to the most prominent voices. One lesson I've learned from the NU2 Feature Selection process is that my decision process is opaque to a lot of people, so I'm trying to post updates more frequently. This is one such note. The interesting thing that I'm hearing right now is that out of my NU3 wishlist items (https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/a-note-on-electric-coin-company-process/32400/3), the one that people pick when I say they can pick only one is "Toxic-waste-free proving systems (Bulletproofs!) or other cryptographic techniques to further prevent and mitigate cryptographic breakthroughs, bugs, etc". (Note: if "zaddrs by default / good wallet support" were one of the options, everyone would've picked that.)

Hey
I have a question about Zk-Snarks: Is it possible to include in a Zk-Snark transaction or just a Zk-Snark a timestamp? An exmple of this would be to verify a trasaction has been made after X time or Y block.
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:33 AM
@ex you could just send a private transaction Z-Z address with a memo. Save the TXID and later you can prove when the memo was sent if needed
For Z - Z transactions, the essentially just appear as timestamps on the Blockchain
ex 9:34 AM
I was thinking more of an automatic, blockchain implemented way
oh ok
Thanks @mineZcash I'll look into that üôÇ

Could you help me with general understanding of mathematical issues of your security algorithm. For example, why you have chosen zksnark?

How do you generate big elliptic curves appropriate for your tasks?

@dmitrynvm, these are great questions. I don't know of any single resource to answer all of these with the requisite context, but the Zerocash academic paper (https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/349) is a good start. In a nutshell:
Why zk-SNARK? It's analogous to asking why "encryption" to protect information. Let's enumerate what we need. We need to prove complex statement (here: the validity of a transaction) in a way that is convincing ("ARgument of Knowledge"), with proofs that are small and easy to verify ("Succinct"), and moreover can be just written down and put on the blockchain ("Noninteractive"), and without revealing anything about the content of the transaction ("Zero Knowledge"). zk-SNARK is simply the formal definition of these properties. And fortunately, there exist cryptographic schemes that fulfill these properties.
The best (most efficient) zk-SNARKs known today indeed use pairings on elliptic curves, to perform the verification. See https://eprint.iacr.org/2012/718 for some intuition on why.

    eprint.iacr.org
    Cryptology ePrint Archive: Report 2012/718 - Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments via Linear Interactive Proofs

Choosing suitable elliptic curves involves *many* considerations. For the choice used in Zcash Sapling, see https://z.cash/blog/new-snark-curve/.

Hello
CAn anybody help me to send ZCASH from a ledger wallet? I have newest firmware and wallet, but it is not allowing it to be send
Put it on the ledger late 2017
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 9:35 AM
There have been multiple reports of people having problems with Ledger. I'm afraid you have to contact their customer support. If I recall correctly, it affects people who are trying to move funds that they have mined directly on the Ledger wallet. Perhaps it occurs in other scenarios too but this is what I remember.

@jona.derks I also heard from others in the company who have a ledger that even when you successfully send a transaction, Leger currently shows an error message that makes it appear like it has not been able to send. Maybe you should wait and see if that's also happening to you, and maybe it's functioning but looking broken in the GUI.

@jona.derks Are you using the Ledger Chrome extension (entitled "Ledger Wallet Bitcoin" in the Chrome web store) or the newer "Ledger Live" application? Since the Sapling Upgrade, I don't think you can send ZEC via the Ledger Chrome extension. I think you have to use Ledger Live (https://www.ledger.com/pages/ledger-live), but I'm not sure about that.

Good Morning. WIth Ledger you definately have to use the new "Ledger Live" (desktop app) i have used it to receive and send ZEC from Bittrex and back, without any problems so all works well. I will add the UI for this new Ledger live is not great and the balance section can be a little confusing. But as far as transactions go, all 100% great.

BUT.... Ledger rolled out a new update. For thel ast 3 days, ive had a bit of a nightmare trying to update my Ledger nano S. Basically it starts updates, take over 12hts to reach 100%, ten it gets "Stuck" on a flashing ledger logo on screen. Three times ive tried different things over 3 days and yesterday was final straw. So i suggest anyone with a Ledger, do not update it just yet, or you could easily face the problems myself and many are having.

So there is still tx malleability in Zcash then, just to double check?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:40 AM
It's maaaybe possible to create non-malleable transactions if they have shielded components, but honestly I think it would be easier to switch to a transaction format that doesn't rely on canonicalisation for cryptographic verification.
i.e. the transaction data (or subsets of it as necessary) are authenticated with a Merkleized hashing scheme.

The "meme" suggests Mr Wilcox "Founders" reward is worth $300,000 a Month. Is this correct? Also, if you would be so kind, what is the amount given to the founders, that i believe to be around 20 in total? Also, maybe a good idea to give a break down of the expenditures, im sure Mr Wilcox does not get to "keep" all of that amount as this project , like many in Crypto, does not run on thin air. ‚ò∫

6,125 Zec per month to foundation, is a huge figure, im sure it is being Hodl'd away for next bull run when prices will surpass $1,000. So thats over $6 MILLION USD worth of ZEC monthly to the foundation. Wow... with this kind of finance, you can pretty much hire all the best people in the world. Question is... Is it not too much?
Maybe some of the funds goes towards charity? Maybe helping people in 3rd world countries have access to computers, internet and of course ZEC and BTC.

Clearly in very good standing financially. Hopefully there will be good news for the hiring efforts over this year, i should think there are applicants daily, Zcash is clearly a top 3 project in Crypto. Regarding Zcon1 how many places/tickets are available please?
just one point regarding the article, at the end, which i find baffling. "Longer term, we need to start thinking about how the Foundation can sustainably operate with donations in addition to its endowment, which will entail a concerted effort to solicit donations from the community in the future." Solicit donations from the community? The 6125 Zcash awarded to the foundation, seems more than enough to easily "get by" on. Why would they ever be a need to get donations?
z-888 8:56 AM
*i understand this is a "touchy" subject, (from articles i see) But my questions are most sincere. ‚ò∫
mineZcash Admin Owner 9:23 AM
@z-888 you can see in the Foundation blog post the amount funded is enough for several years: ">At a price of $50 USD per ZEC, we have roughly $16 million in assets, which translates to a five-year runway if we meet the 2019 expected budget. Obviously swings in ZEC price could materially change this calculation."

Thank @mineZcash pretty sure no one here values Zec at $50. Mine have 4 figure value thats for sure. Regarding the "5 year runway" given a more realistic value of $500+ per Zec. That would give minimum of $160m. Now, any company on this planet worth its salt, can grow into something massive with such funds. As long as Crypto is here to stay, which hopefully it will be, then, all shall be well.

I don't speculate on future Zcash price, but of course a higher ZEC value would allow for more USD funding for Zcash development üôÇ

The vulnerability was specific to counterfeiting and did not affect user privacy in any way. Prior to its remediation, an attacker could have created fake Zcash without being detected.

mineZcash Admin Owner 9:38 AM
Just for more info, I've had a couple PMs asking about details about why am closing the store for now: The fee per month is not a huge deal and not the biggest issue. All of the current products no longer have the correct logos and have to be updated (lots of time needed), along with updated mock-ups, and raised prices for new shipping rates. Plus the site only gets about 5 visitors per day, accepting Zcash and cryptocurrency as payment is a accounting headache as I'm sitting down trying to figure out my taxes this year. I've tried to run ADs on both Google and Facebook only to have my accounts banned because it's "related" to cryptocurrency.
Simply put, not enough people are interested in buying Zcash branded stuff to cover even the basic monthly costs, plus all the back end work that needs to be done making it hard to justify the time and expense to keep it open. Feel free to change my mind üôÇ

Good Day everyone. I am just reading a new article about Zcash multisig. https://www.zfnd.org/blog/kzen-multisig/

    Partnering with KZen Networks to Enable Private Multisig
    KZen Networks is undertaking a research project funded by the Zcash Foundation.

Q: Will this be able to work with ledger or Trezor and just as importantly exchanges?
For example, i reached out to Bittrex today, i want to change my email, should be straight forward, but i have yet to have a reply from them, but they did put my account on "hold" (my email for that site was pwned). Now if i could have a extra layer of protection when withdrawing funds, i could sleep a lot better and can enhance greatly the protection offered by exchanges. ‚ò∫

Thank you @john.bruhling
z-888 5:28 AM
So.. "Wallets that are both full-featured and easy to use are critical for Zcash adoption" Key Word "Critical".
Ive been investing in altcoins since late 2013. When it was mostly (or even only) QT wallets. I know how they work in general. But looknig at the Zcash wallet it says a node is required. Reading the github notes, am i correct in thinking it is a automated process?
LEts say, most people who will adopt Zcash use WIndows, as this is the most used OS in the world. So i will use windows as the example.
"zec-qt-wallet needs a Zcash node running zcashd" ok, to the average person, who is the target audience (i should think) for Mass Adoption. The y are not going to like the sound of this and will probably stop here. But lets say they continue....
For the "average" person, this might as well be written in alien text "Additionally, if this is the first time you're running zec-qt-wallet or a zcashd daemon, zec-qt-wallet will download the zcash params (~1.7 GB) and configure zcash.conf for you.

Pass --no-embedded to disable the embedded zcashd and force zec-qt-wallet to connect to an external node."
...
So for Zcash to have a chance at mass adoption, for the general population (maybe you are thinking of business adoption and people who know how to use basic code and programming?) these little details need to be more clear.
...
i ran QT wallets before, 2013-2015, mostly POS for staking. But i have no idea when it comes to running nodes, like a lot of people in Crypto. The android wallet needs this QT wallet to work, so you can see a lot of people will get stuck at the first hurdle.
...
Then of course, many, millions, billions of people around the world, who would be critical to mass adoption, they dont even have computers. What about these guys? They wont be able to use the ZEC android/ios wallet ?

adityapk00 10:16 AM
@unclebeans - You can run zcashd manually. Start a command prompt, cd to the directory with zcashd, and the run `zcashd.exe`
That should start zcashd, and output any errors that are preventing it from starting.
If it starts properly, you can then run zec-qt-wallet, and it will automatically connect to zcashd

@marsh how to fix them?
marsh February 16, 2019 10:20 AM
Looks like you have corrupted parameters
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:24 AM
Search your Windows file system for a file called `sapling-spend.params`
Where ever this is located on your Windows system, I would remove all the files in this directory
That folder will likely contain these other files

```
sprout-proving.key"
    "sprout-verifying.key" 
    "sapling-spend.params" 
    "sapling-output.params"
    "sprout-groth16.params"
   README

```

Ensure your node zec-qt-wallet is completely shutdown
Then restart the zec-qt-wallet
This should re download the params needed to run the node
I would assume zec-qt sanity checks the SHA on all these files, after DL but I haven't dove into the zec-qt code
unclebeans 10:28 AM
@marsh I can not find the folder sapling-params ... in the folder C: \ Windows \ system
marsh February 16, 2019 10:24 AM
Search your Windows file system for a file called `sapling-spend.params`
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:29 AM
Are any of those files on your system?
I would pass searching on README, that will just generate flim flam in your file search
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:32 AM
If it's easier, just uninstall zec-qt-wallet and install from scratch.
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:32 AM
That is likely a much better approach

removed using geek uninstaller, reboot, re install, run zcashd.exe with cmd.exe, after run zec-qt-wallet.exe the same mistake
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:55 AM
Do you have administrator privileges on this Windows user account? I'm thinking that perhaps zec-qt-wallet is trying to download the parameters in a folder you don't have admin access to and thus the installation is incomplete, resulting in that error when the wallet is loaded.
unclebeans 10:57 AM
yes of course i'm administrator of this comp, and run zec qt wallet with "Run as administrator"

So the corrupted parameters are still there.
Delete `C:/Users/Dell/AppData/Roaming/ZcashParams`
And while you're at it, delete `C:\Users\Dell\AppData\Roaming\Zcash` as well.
Uninstall zec-qt-wallet and reinstall. This time it should work ‚ò∫
Keep in mind that the parameters are 1.69GB so downloading them may take a while. After the wallet is loaded, the Zcash blockchain will be downloaded, which is currently 22,48GB. So be patient, as you are about to do quite a bit of downloading.

Does any cypto market or wallet support transfer ZEC to `z-addr`?
I'm using Atomic Wallet, but it only support transfer ZEC to `t-addr`
When I input `z-addr` to the receive address, it emit an error `Please check address`

Oh, I get it. I can transfer ZEC to `t-addr` created in `zcash-cli`, and then transfer it to `z-addr`.

thank you @dimitris.apostolou is it "plug and play"? In the past the only QT wallets i have had, have been POS, simply download, install and job done. But i think, i need to do more once i have installed it on windows?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:06 AM
It is a full node, which means it will download the 1.69GB parameters and then it will download the 22,48GB blockchain. It all happens automatically though.

for sure, should be fine. . Many thanks. Only question i have right now, is, if you know of any conflicts on windows 8.1 OS. My machine is pretty slimmed down and does not have too many programs. I do have VPN.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:15 AM
I'm not aware of any conflicts. It should work right out of the box. And if you ever used winZEC or some similar wallet, zec-qt-wallet will automatically reuse your current wallet and you will continue from where you left.

@cryptoindio Welcome to the Zcash community üôÇ

Feel free to have a look at the Zcash GitHub repository https://github.com/zcash/zcash/projects/27 and familiarize yourself with the code. There is a special project there called "Encouraged Community Work", which is stuff that the Zcash devs do not have the time and capacity to deliver in the near future so community engagement is greatly encouraged. Some of those issues are tagged "good first issue" and those are good ones for newcomers to have a look at.

The documentation is staged at https://gitlab.com/zcash-docs/zcash-docs and merge requests for improvements are also welcomed.

Regarding errors. I know this is a slim chance of it happening. But once i was in another country and my computer set to that time, one hour behind local time.

What version of macOS?
cryptoindio 10:10 AM
Mojave, should I run `autogen.sh && configure`?
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:19 AM
@cryptoindio Please issue `make clean` and then re run `build.sh -j8`
Otherwise there was some odd stuff with certain version of Mac, but they seemed to be resolved. I have not gone to sanity check them though.
cryptoindio 10:22 AM
it won't work, I guess there are env variables that were changed that's why it caused this. I'll just download a fresh Ubuntu VM
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:23 AM
Not that it should matter, but does `build.sh` work without specifying `j#`

It stopped `unistd` mine didn't even get near that part, I'll try
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:36 AM
Are you using `brew` to get packages?
IIRC I was able to resolve this with `coreutils` through `brew install coreutils`
Also the script should pickup your system info for HOST, IIRC
cryptoindio 10:40 AM
so I am just manually doing `make` inside `depends` I'll see how this goes.
marsh Electric Coin Company 10:41 AM
I'm not sure it will work because `build.sh` is doing a couple layers of `autoconf` related things
If you got your build into an intermediate state, the auto generated things will be broke
I have to check out some Mac stuff later, so I'll take a look and see what I can reproduce here.
cryptoindio 10:49 AM
so I changed the `build.sh` a bit, it seems to work on my system if I place the `pwd/zcash` path rather than doing some `./path` relatve paths
example.
I changed the `./depends` -> `pwd/zcash/depends` bad hack I think
garethtdavies 12:34 PM
I just tested on a freshly upgraded Mac and that fix in the issue actually no longer works on 10.14.3 and just returns `The file /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg does not exist`. It did get to the same error though ` include <unistd.h>` so I'll have a bit of a play later to update this.
marsh Electric Coin Company 12:52 PM
Ty @garethtdavies . Much appreciated!
garethtdavies 2:11 PM

@paige Wow! Did not realize this was just a .dat file. TY. This was much easier than expected.
cryptoindio 6:27 PM
@marsh and @garethtdavies it seems to build now, so I just did a cd to `zcutil` then `build.sh` rather than doing `./zcutil/bulid.sh`

@jayasai What do you mean it is starting from the first block each time? Are you creating a new wallet each time you start?
Also sanity check the t-add you deposited funds too. I don't use that block explorer you linked too, so I can't gauge where the issue might be

it was showing till the current testnet block
sync
marsh Electric Coin Company 7:04 AM
It takes a few seconds to get state before you can issue RPC commands
It isn't instant and the logs will likely show validation from 0 unless you pass in params
It's not actually downloading blocks each time from 0 or it take your node 3-6 hours just to sync every time you start it
What does the daemon show you? Ignore the logs for now
If you issue `zcashd` and it starts.... you see the heart and the zcash ascii icon
What is the text below that saying?
jayasai 7:08 AM
Ya ok but now i'm running it on daemon .
when i see last time it says Activating best chain...

@cryptoindio we don't use the term "stealth address" in Zcash. however, the technique for keeping the destination address of payments private is essentially the same as Monero stealth addresses. we don't use that term because the Zerocash paper didn't, and we don't think of it as a feature separate from the rest of the shielded protocol

sounds like a card/street i can buy on Monopoly. Would it also give the team more flexibility pursuing other ventures? This line stands out.
"The Electric Coin Company is focused on building and supporting Zcash. That includes research and engineering that may, or may not, ever make it into Zcash software."
It suggests that other ventures will be pursued.

@z-888 It's more of a reference to R&D that's part of the natural process. For example, we may do research work on various cryptographic techniques for scalability, without commitment to actually using them. But it's all for the benefit of Zcash.

What are some good semi-technical resources to learn about Zk-Snarks?
Or more specific my question Is what inputs do you need to create a Zk-snark and what does the recipient need to know to verify it (transaction for example)?

The Burner wallet is "unique" because of the fast , five second transaction times and super low fees? The only thing i can think of, that would be a big challenge to this wallet, is Bitcoin and lightening network. As it also has fast transactions and super low fees right?

mineZcash Admin Owner 8:06 AM
@1 what are you talking about?
mineZcash Admin Owner 8:52 AM
@zooko that looks like a really cool project. I'm not sure I understand what exactly was happening. It looks like they scanned a token to get credits, which they could then use towards food on food trucks. I assume the patrons could not cash out the credits to USD, but rather the vendors could show the credits they earned to the organizers at the end of the show to be reimbursed?
z-888 10:30 AM
@mineZcash "Okay, now from the perspective of a food truck. We asked all eleven food trucks to sign up for a Wyre account before arriving Friday morning. When they showed up we used their iPad to scan a special vendor private key. Then we printed a QR code for them to display at their truck:"
"There was a special clause in the smart contracts to only allow vendors to off-ramp. At the end of the night each vendor pressed a ‚ÄúCash Out‚Äù button to initiate a Wyre transfer of the revenue they earned that day to their bank account."
when they took a order and payment the payment must have been locked to the exact same price later that day. So no fluctuation.
"For same currency transfers (e.g. USD/USD), Wyre will charge a 0.20% processing fee, or a minimum fee, determined by payout currency. This means that if the 0.20% fee is less than the minimum fee, we'll charge you a flat fee for your transfer."
*usd>usd fee.
Now when @zooko said " wonder if we could do something similar at Zcon One: " I presume with ZEC. Not entirely sure how thing stand/work, when it comes to accepting ZEC payments. Maybe the Hotel would be interested in offering 5% discount when paying with ZCash.
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:47 AM
That article is kind of misleading, it makes it seem like it was insanely cheap to do it that way: "That means for all of the transactions for all of the meals the cost of running the wallet on xDai was $0.20!!!"
z-888 10:50 AM
that was the total transaction costs for the cryptocurrency transactions for sure. But indeed, it does not take into account the fees from the transfer to account. Would really have to use it to know for sure.
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:51 AM
But that only applies to the on-chain fees. As you mentioned, they also took a 0.20% fee from the food trucks to convert to USD so at $38,432.56 the fees incurred were $76.86?
Still lower than I think a Visa/MasterCard would have charged. (If my calculation is correct)
mineZcash Admin Owner 11:02 AM
I think Zcash on-chain fees could also be extremely cheap for something like this, right now at $51 and a default TX fee of 0.0001ZEC would have cost less than a penny ($0.0051) per transaction.
z-888 11:21 AM
exactly, look forward to the day when it happens. Also it would be great to introduce a option to allow a percentage that gets converted to fiat, so you (the vendor) could keep part of the transaction in crypto "savings". EG: Take the cost only and transfer/keep the rest in of the crypto payment in crypto.
and to take the "option" further, set aside more percentage for monthly bills. Most people are not so great at saving and dread the end of the month for bills, but with options like this, you would already have the bills paid at the end of every month.
EG: i have 30 euro mobile fee per month, every sale/ payment i receive i can automatically send X amount 7.50) to my phone company account, end of month, payment would be made in full.
or lets say in the future, you have companies paying people in ZEC each month, direct to Zcash wallet, which automatically (if they chose so) to pay their bills and even savings and such. Would take away all the hassle each month about worrying about bills. One thing in life we all have... bill payments. One thing most people are not great at doing, making those payments on time, every time. üôÇ
Restaurant. 10 people, big bill end of night $1,267.58 They all have zec wallet, waiter allows customers to scan qr code and it automatically gives them the share of the bill with option for tip. Point im trying to make (often not so good at this). Extreme ease of use, every day use, strong use case for people, worldwide.

    Extending the Anonymity of Zcash
    Although Bitcoin in its original whitepaper stated that it offers anonymous transactions, de-anonymization techniques have found otherwise. Therefore, alternative cryptocurrencies, like Dash, Monero, and Zcash, were developed to provide better privacy. As Edward Snowden stated, "Zcash's privacy tech makes it the most interesting Bitcoin alternative (...) because the privacy properties of it are truly unique". Zcash's privacy is based on peer-reviewed cryptographic constructions, hence it is considered to provide the foundations for the best anonymity. However, even Zcash makes some privacy concessions. It does not protect users' privacy in the presence of a global adversary who is able to observe the whole network, and hence correlate the parties exchanging money, by using their network addresses. The recent empirical analysis of Zcash shows, that users often choose naive ways while performing the protocol operations, not realizing that it degrades their anonymity. In this talk, we will discuss an extension of Zcash using mix networks to enhance the privacy guarantees of users that choose to remain anonymous by tackling two major security challenges: one at the application layer of the scheme and one at its network layer.

Hi everyone, I have just began to study the zcash, especially the sapling. I have just build the codes in my computer using the config with testnet, and my question is is there a exited address which I can use to test, such as sendmany, because these functions need account with money.
marsh Electric Coin Company 9:36 PM
@shiziwen You will need to use the faucet and send to a t-addr for now
shiziwen 9:37 PM
@marsh Do you mean this? https://faucet.testnet.z.cash/

@shiziwen You will need to use the faucet and send to a t-addr for now
marsh Electric Coin Company 9:37 PM
Yep, was just about to post the link. You can ignore the SSL cert for now. We are gonna update that soon
Also the faucet needs to be updated, otherwise you could just send to a sapling addr
shiziwen 9:38 PM
ok, thanks.
marsh Electric Coin Company 9:38 PM
For now it is easier to just send to your t-addr then move those funds into z-addrs
And if that doesn't work, let us know. Several of us here have TAZ. TAZ is basically testnet funds that are for testing
shiziwen 9:40 PM
I have just create a new address using "zcash-cli z_getnewaddress", and paste the address into the label. And how can I to verify that I have received the TAZ? Is there any commands provided to get the detail of the address?

okÔºåthanks
So after I create the t-addr, and then create a z-addr, I can test the z_sendmany command, right?
I want to test the Anonymous Payment, and try to what happens in zcash.
@marsh
marsh Electric Coin Company 9:47 PM
Yeah
Just keep in mind you cant send from sprout to sapling directly
You have to migrate through a t-addr
So if you have funds in a sprout z-addr you need to send them to a t-addr, then t-addr into z-addr sapling

Good Day everyone. Having just read the recent newsletter "ZF Grants" I have two questions please.
1- Does the Foundation give "X" donation to qualifying projects
or
2. Does the foundation only "Match" donations from the community?
What i mean is, that the projects wont have to rely solely upon donations from the community, right?
Just, considering how much the foundation is rewarded each month, i think it will be a very hard "sell" to get community members to part with Zcash to fund projects .
also "only" $500 for "Critical bug disclosures" seems on the low side, considering the impact a critical bug could have and in turn, cost.
z-888 1:55 AM
I see "Kickstarter" was mentioned. When you donate to a project, you are rewarded with some cool merch or similar. Now, thinking about a different approach and how the national lottery does things in the UK. IDEA:
You could reward people who donate with entries into a "lottery". Donations for every $5 get a Ticket/Number into a draw, to win Zec. A small percentage of the Zec donation goes towards the prize pool and every month winners are drawn. OF course, like any system, this could "roll-over" meaning higher jackpot, like your typical lotto/lottery system. This would have several benefits (if possible to do, by law)
People are far more willing to donate, if they get or stand a chance to get something in return (why the lotto is so popular). In turn the projects for ZF Grants would attract far more donations and the platform would become more popular and more widely used and could become "the go to" for any project.

How could I use the librustzcash in macOS using Java? I found that JNA/JNI may be a resolution, but before that, I should compare it to dylib.
How can I get the dylib of librustzcash?
shiziwen 5:32 AM
Can I build the zcash to some .so files or dylib files?

Does anyone know about the compiler_builtins-* files? such as compiler_builtins-5a1729899e5224d3.compiler_builtins0-4df412208113a83890ede43a72d3e592.rs.rcgu.o. What do these files do? I use "ar -x librustzcash.a
" command, and found that there were lots of files like this.
@marsh
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:02 AM
@shiziwen that all comes from the Rust compiler and standard library.
shiziwen 12:04 AM
ar -x librustzcash.a && gcc -dynamiclib *.o -o librustzcash.dylib -v
I used the above commands to get dylib, but it failed.
@str4d duplicate symbol ___floatdisf in:

@shiziwen you can't take the Linux binary library and modify it for MacOS; you need to compile it targeting that platform
shiziwen 12:10 AM
@str4d I build the codes on MacOS
And got the librustzcash.a in zcash/depends/x86_64-apple-darwin17.7.0/lib/
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:12 AM
Then that's the static library you'd need
(if you want to use the librustzcash FFI)
shiziwen 12:13 AM
I want to use java to call some function in zcash, such as the functions in the librustzcash through JNA/JNI
So, in MacOS, I need to get the dylib file.
But now, have got the above problem.
*.a --> *.o, and then put the .o files to the dynamic file, such as dylib in MacOS or so file in Linux
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:15 AM
A dylib is just a dynamic library. The .a should work fine

    ‚òë 1 

.so is the equivalent of a dylib in linux
But if it isn't, then you get a dynamic library by configuring the librustzcash crate to create it
https://github.com/zcash/librustzcash/blob/e4187f07ff2dc8b9acf6ff24cc9596fbf6e4d62b/librustzcash/Cargo.toml#L14 is where we configure it to create a static library. You'd use `cdylib` to have it generate a dynamic library.

shiziwen 12:18 AM
@str4d yes, you are right. "ar -x librustzcash.a && gcc -dynamiclib *.o -o librustzcash.dylib -v" is what I did.
@str4d The functions in librustzcash are part of what I need. So firstly, I plan to use librustzcash as a example to confirm what I think can work.
But unfortunately, I have got errors.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:22 AM
As above, you need to use the Rust compiler to create the dynamic library.
See https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet-sdk/blob/db5abb889c40c1493752e89c554d9ba21dfb4b5c/Cargo.toml#L53 for another example (which in fact is compiling Rust code for use with JNI, on Android)

shiziwen 12:23 AM
What I want, is a common way that I can use to call some function in the zcash, not only the librustzcah.
@str4d Thanks very much.
But I am trying to the common way.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:24 AM
You mean call the general Rust functions? For that you need to write an FFI layer. The Android SDK above is one example of doing this.
Calling the internal Rust functions directly won't work, because Rust doesn't use the C ABI by default.
shiziwen 12:25 AM
librustzcash is the first step, and then, I want to call some other function(C++) in the zcash project, not only the rust.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:26 AM
Oh, I see. That is completely unsupported, so not much I can help you with there.
But if you're trying to get librustzcash compiled as a dynamic library _within_ the zcashd build process, you can do that by applying a patch to it
See https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/depends/patches/librustzcash/remove-dev-dependencies.diff for one of the patches we apply, and https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/master/depends/packages/librustzcash.mk for how we apply it. You could use that to have it also generate a `cdylib`.

I can't help you with `gcc -dynamiclib`, sorry
shiziwen 12:29 AM
@str4d Thank you very much, maybe the way I use is not correct
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:29 AM
Rust uses LLVM under the hood anyway, so IDK if that would even work.
shiziwen 12:29 AM
@str4d I have tried in Linux and get the same erros.
errors
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:31 AM
As I already said above, what you need to do is change `crate-type = ["staticlib"]` to `crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib"]` in `librustzcash/Cargo.toml`, and then it should generate the `dylib` for you when you compile on MacOS.
shiziwen 12:33 AM
@str4d ok, thank you, I will try it.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:34 AM
(If using the zcashd depends system, you'd also have to make sure that file gets copied out, since by default it only copies out the `.a` file)
shiziwen 12:50 AM
@str4d Hi str4d, I have checked the codes and I found that the codes I use have already include the diff file, and the librustzcash.mk you mentioned is the same as I used, so if I want to librustzcash compiled as a dynamic lib within the zcashed build process, what should I do? Should I change the "crate-type" config?

"librustzcash/Cargo.toml" you mentioned above, is included in the librustzcash project, not in the zcash project.
str4d March 19, 2019 12:26 AM
Oh, I see. That is completely unsupported, so not much I can help you with there.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:51 AM
Correct. You'd need to either amend the diff file I linked to make the change, or create a new diff file that does and add it to the .mk file
shiziwen 12:56 AM
@str4d So you mean I should modify the diff file - remove-dev-dependencies.diff - and add the config "crate-type = ["staticlib", "cdylib"]" to the diff file?
str4d March 19, 2019 12:51 AM
Correct. You'd need to either amend the diff file I linked to make the change, or create a new diff file that does and add it to the .mk file
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:56 AM
That's one way to do it
(add a diff section that will modify the `librustzcash/Cargo.toml` file appropriately)
shiziwen 1:34 AM
@str4d @str4d
Hi str4d, I have amend the diff as below, and then rebuild the zcash code, so how can I confirm that I have done the correct job or where I can find the dynamic lib file?

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:46 AM
@shiziwen since you're using the `zcashd` depends system, you need to copy the file out of the workspace once it has been built, otherwise it gets deleted during cleanup. See https://github.com/zcash/zcash/blob/5a8a1b450e355f8d29c7505d5adcf0ea8010303f/depends/packages/librustzcash.mk#L36 for the line you need to duplicate (that line is for the static library).

    Zcashd Security Announcement 2019-03-19
    Synopsis: A bug in the Zcashd wallet could result in Sprout z-addresses displaying an incorrect balance. Sapling z-addresses are not impacted by this issue. This would occur if someone sending funds to a Sprout z-address intentionally sent a different amount in the note commitment of a Sprout output than the value provided in the ciphertext (the encrypted message from the sender). A code fix for the wallet has been written and the integration into an official Zcash release is targeted for our ...

bambam Electric Coin Company 3:05 PM
Not till you come to spend it, no.
So one possible workaround is you shift received funds to another address and see if that succeeds. But applying the source update will work much better, although it requires a manual build.

It's a great find.

str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 7:41 PM
@sarang the check was in the specification, but was missing in the C++ implementation.
This would be a noisy bug if someone had encountered it though (spends would stop working the moment the note started being selected), and we'd have seen issues opened.

@str4d Hi, str4d, sorry for interrupting you again.
What the difference between the latest main branch with the version 2.0.3, especially the librustzcash project, I found that the commit of the librustzash is the same value "06da3b9ac8f278e5d4ae13088cf0a4c03d2c13f5". Does this mean that this version of librustzcash is the stable version?
Again, when will the new release will be released? Maybe v2.0.4?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:35 PM
The librustzcash commit used in zcashd is the stable version, yes. There won't be any changes to the version zcashd uses before 2.0.4.
The latest commit in the master branch of the librustzcash repo is not as stable, because we are in the middle of a refactor.
shiziwen 9:38 PM
@str4d So what are the main modifications in the zcash project?
If I want to study the zcash, can I use the latest main branch or it is recommended to use the 2.0.3 release?
str4d March 19, 2019 9:35 PM
The latest commit in the master branch of the librustzcash repo is not as stable, because we are in the middle of a refactor.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:50 PM
If you're studying it, latest master is fine. Generally you'd want to run a released version, but 2.0.4 will be out in around a week
shiziwen 9:52 PM
@str4d Thanks very much. Can you tell me about the modifications between the 2.0.4 and 2.0.3?
str4d March 19, 2019 9:50 PM
If you're studying it, latest master is fine. Generally you'd want to run a released version, but 2.0.4 will be out in around a week
@str4d I found there are "80 files changed, 1193 insertions(+), 1685 deletions(-)", but it is different to find more detail if I do not read the code.

Thanks - that's perfect!
So I shouldn't send any funds to the sapling Z address until the upgrade?
Will my address change or remain the same?
bambam Electric Coin Company 3:49 PM
Sapling Z addresses aren't affected by the most recent bug if that's what you're referring to.
Only Sprout addresses.
I'd stick with Sapling as its way way faster.
Newer, etc..
allen.b 3:56 PM
I downloaded the wallet you sent over, but it's showing this message right under the Z-address "You should suspend trust in the receipt of funds to Sprout z-addresses until you upgrade to zcashd v2.0.4. See Security Announcement"

The wallet won't allow me to create a new address unless it's a t-address.

Does the wallet have to fully sync before I can generate a sapling address?
allen.b 4:07 PM
I don't see anything about sapling z addresses in this wallet besides the turnstile migration option (which doesn't have a send to address).
adityapk00 4:19 PM

Can someone explain what are sprouting and sapling addresses? Thanks!
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 12:25 PM
@Nathan01 The super-simplified explanation: Sprout addresses are the legacy addresses. Sprout z-addresses are slow and hard to compute. Sapling addresses are the new addresses. Sapling z-addresses are fast and light.

is there a recommended way to upgrade an original sprout 1.0.x wallet? i'm running with upgradewallet=1 and salvagewallet=1 but its seemingly taking forever to rescan? the last thing in debug.log is the node being shutdown
garethtdavies 2:16 PM
@kevin You need to send the funds from your Sprout addresses to Sapling ones via the transparent pool i.e to transparent addresses first. There is much more here in how to do this in a privacy preserving way with a migration tool being released soon: https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/sapling_turnstile.html. Those options you specified won't move your funds. If you have a lot of shielded addresses rescanning can be very slow so you might just need to wait.

@garethtdavies yet that can be done with the latest version of the reference implementation correct?

Hi, how can I verify the sapling address is valid?
In the codes, I found like this:
bool IsValidPaymentAddress(const libzcash::PaymentAddress& zaddr) {
return zaddr.which() != 0;
}

But besides this, how can i check a address is a valid sapling address?

@paige Thank you. But I know it is the rpc interface, and from it will call the code I posted.
I wish to know more about how to check a address is valid except the rpc interface.
Because from the codes, I just find the 'zaddr.which()', and it is the function of the variant in boost.

@shiziwen https://zcash-rpc.github.io/z_validateaddress.html
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 11:40 AM
@shiziwen the way that function works, is that you first call `DecodePaymentAddress`, which checks the address validity and returns a `boost::variant` representing either a valid address, or an "invalid type" which is what the above function is checking for.

@str4d
shiziwen 9:09 PM
@str4d Thanks for your reply.
I have read the codes, when creating a new address, the last step is to call the rust lib function - librustzcash_zip32_xfvk_address- and we can get a char array. How can I valid this char array is correct before convert it to a SaplingPaymentAddress struct?
str4d March 26, 2019 11:40 AM

james-EU March 26, 2019 9:07 PM
how can I find the restrictive conditions before circuit in sapling?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:11 PM
@james-EU do you mean the network consensus rules? The Sprout circuit constraints? Or the Sapling circuit constraints?
james-EU 9:11 PM
Sapling circuit constraints
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:12 PM
The high-level constraints for the Sapling spend and output circuits are specified in sections 4.15.2 and 4.15.3 of the Zcash protocol spec: https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf

    github.com
    zcash/zips
    Zcash Improvement Proposals. Contribute to zcash/zips development by creating an account on GitHub.

Those in turn rely on functions and types defined elsewhere in the spec, which have their own constraints.
james-EU 9:15 PM
ok, i have read that. but I can't find how to prove that a coin belongs to you not someone else
james-EU 9:16 PM
File Uploaded: Clipboard - March 27, 2019 11:16 AM
in Sprout, there is a constraint
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:16 PM
@shiziwen the function you mentioned returns a boolean, which is true if a valid address could be derived from `xfvk`.
@james-EU ah, that part happens outside the circuit
james-EU 9:17 PM
but i can't find a constraint in sapling like this
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:17 PM
This is one of the changes we made in Sapling
that enables delegated spend authority, so that a device like a hardware wallet can authorize spends even if they can't make proofs.
The circuit constraint you are looking for is the "Spend Authority" constraint in the Sapling spend circuit.
It requires that `rk` is a valid re-randomisation of `ak`.
james-EU 9:19 PM
every coin has a RK?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:19 PM
`ak` is the long-term "public key" that controls spend authority, with a private key `ask`
james-EU 9:19 PM
yes
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:20 PM
`rk` is a per-spend "public key", generated by re-randomizing `ak` with a random `alpha`
It's not linked to the note being spent
Then, outside the circuit, the spender makes a signature with `rsk`, which is the private key corresponding to `rk`, and the re-randomisation of `ask` with `alpha`.
(`spendAuthSig` in the `SpendDescription`)
james-EU 9:21 PM
yes
i have read this
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:21 PM
That's it.
james-EU 9:21 PM
but how to link a rk to a note?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:22 PM
`rk` is linked to `ak`.
`ak` is linked to `ivk`
`ivk` is linked to `pk_d`
james-EU 9:22 PM
yes
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:22 PM
And `pk_d` is part of the note.
Those three links are all enforced with circuit constraints.
james-EU 9:23 PM
ok, but I can't find the circuit constraints in the white paper
rk = SpendAuthSig.RandomizePublic(Œ±, ak).
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:24 PM
They're right there
Diversified address integrity
And the one you posted above
james-EU 9:25 PM
ok, I will read it again
thanks
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:25 PM
np üôÇ
james-EU 9:54 PM
when you spent a note, I think RK
when you spent a note, I think RK is generated by yourself ? right
@str4d
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 9:59 PM
Yes, you randomly select a fresh alpha for each Sapling spend while creating the transaction.
james-EU 10:00 PM
for example, I sent you a note. how to prevent others to spend this note?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:03 PM
Only I know `ask`.
So only I can derive `rsk` and create a valid `spendAuthSig`.
james-EU 10:04 PM
the note I send to you is link to your ask?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:05 PM
Yes, because it's linked to `ak`
james-EU 10:06 PM
File Uploaded: Clipboard - March 27, 2019 12:06 PM
this is the output note. How does the note link to your ask
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:07 PM
I already said above
str4d March 26, 2019 9:22 PM
`ak` is linked to `ivk`
str4d March 26, 2019 9:22 PM
`ivk` is linked to `pk_d`
str4d March 26, 2019 9:22 PM
And `pk_d` is part of the note.
What you've posted above is an output description, not a note
An output description contains sufficient information for the recipient to recreate the note
james-EU 10:10 PM
yes, I can decrypt it to get the note
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:10 PM
The note is linked to the output description through the note commitment `cmu`
Decryption gets you the note plaintext, from which you can derive the note.
james-EU 10:11 PM
yes, I understand this. I will try to understand the Spend authority
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:14 PM
See section 3.2 for the definition of a Sapling note.
james-EU 10:14 PM
ok
james-EU 10:20 PM
File Uploaded: Clipboard - March 27, 2019 12:20 PM
is there a check the relation between rk and pk_d?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:25 PM
I don't have more time to explain this again, so here's the brief summary:
- The relationship between `rk` and `ak` is enforced by the constraint labeled "Spend authority" in the Sapling spend circuit.
- The relationship between `ak` and `ivk`, and between `ivk` and `pk_d`, is enforced by the constraints labeled "Diversified address integrity" in the Sapling spend circuit.
james-EU 10:35 PM
yes, I know this. but you generate rk, alpha, ak, ivk. and you do a sign by rsk. But i can‚Äôt find how to prove you can spent the note
I will do more research on your paper
thanks
james-EU 1:00 AM
in section 4.15.2, is the primary input rk generated at spend suthorization signature step?

    ‚òë 1 

and in section 4.15.2, check the rk equals SpendAuthSig.RandomizePublic(Œ±, ak) or not ?

    ‚òë 1

HiÔºåin the codes, I found many functions have called the ConvertBits, what does this function will do?
There are some notes like below:
/**
* Convert from one power-of-2 number base to another.
*
* Examples using ConvertBits<8, 5, true>():
* 000000 -> 0000000000
* 202020 -> 0400100200
* 757575 -> 0e151a170a
* abcdef -> 150f061e1e
* ffffff -> 1f1f1f1f1e
*/

What does the "00000" means?

When I use the rpc command z_sendmany, it returned "Invalid parameter, Sapling has not activated", but I can use it several days before.
Is there something wrong during the process?
Maybe I haven't downloading the enough blocks?
@str4d
Every time when I started zcash, I will delete the testnet3 file.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:16 AM
@shiziwen there's your problem. If you delete the testnet3 folder, your node (which I assume you are running in testnet mode) will need to download all the testnet blocks again.
So then you have to wait until it's downloaded enough blocks to reach testnet Sapling activation, before commands that require Sapling will work.

This is a relative new constructions that can be used to produce random in a blockchain and/or to get rid of the POW energy wasting "plague" cc @gtank @str4d @daira @zooko . Many other cryptocurrencies are evaluating introducing VDF most notably Etherum 2.0 https://www.thecryptoupdates.com/ethereum-betting-15-million-on-vdf-tech-for-serenity/

when I run zcash on the testmode, is there DB file I can download?
Because every time I run it, it will activating best chain, or when I delete the testnet3 dir, they both will cost several hours before it download all the blocks or check them.
If you provide the DB file, I can download it and run the zcash, so I just only need to fetch smaller blocks that not exit in the DB file.
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:01 PM
@shiziwen I don't believe Zcash supports Blockchain snapshots for nodes. One workaround I have seen is users copying the chainstate from another Node they have already synced, but it's not recommended because as a new Node downloads blocks it checks the chain integrity.
shiziwen 8:31 PM
@mineZcash I think you are right, copying chainstate from another Node may be not a good way. Because when I kill the zcash thread and restart it immediately, it also will activate the best chain, may be check all the blocks, it will cost a very long time.
mineZcash April 2, 2019 2:01 PM
@shiziwen I don't believe Zcash supports Blockchain snapshots for nodes. One workaround I have seen is users copying the chainstate from another Node they have already synced, but it's not recommended because as a new Node downloads blocks it checks the chain integrity.
So is there any better way to save time?
Or using the kill command is not recommended?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 8:56 PM
@shiziwen using the kill command is definitely not recommended, and is probably causing all your problems
Killing the zcashd process means it can't write out its caches, which is why it will be rescanning and activating the best chain each time you restart.
Use `zcash-cli stop` instead
But why are you wanting to kill zcashd and restart it immediately? zcashd is not designed as a short-running process, but as a long-running service

So, right now atomic swap is not supported by zcash protocol. Am I right?
mineZcash Admin Owner 10:08 AM
That's correct, it's not natively supported in the base layer protocol. Anyone can use the code and update it to work but I don't think its on ECC roadmap to be officially supported.

Q: Has anyone from the Team Here reached out to Bitstamp ? One of the older and more trusted Bitcoin exchanges in this space, they do allow a few other "altcoins" it would be a really Big addition if people could buy ZCash from Bitstamp.

    Announcing Ycash, The First "Friendly Fork" of the Zcash Blockchain
    Introduction At block height 570,000 of the Zcash blockchain (approximately July 18, 2019), we will launch Ycash, the first ‚ÄúFriendly Fork‚Äù of the Zcash blockchain. Because Ycash is a chain fork of Zcash, everyone holding Zcash at the time of the fork will receive the exact same amount of Ycash. (Note: To ensure that you get your Ycash, you must possess your Zcash private keys.) Along with the blockchain fork, ZecWallet will also be forked to support Ycash, and official builds for all supporte...

sarang 11:57 AM
The usual warning with chain forks, of course, applies... never give your private keys to any entity you don't fully trust with the balance contained therein

z-888 4:33 AM
Good day fellow Zcash'ers. Im just reading about YCash (Friendly fork of Zcash) and it says "Note: To ensure that you get your Ycash, you must possess your Zcash private keys"
I presume that means No Exchanges will be taking part in the YCash giveaway? (for every ZEC you get YEC)
and also to confirm, this (YCash) has the "Blessing" of the Zcash team here?
Lastly, i dont really get/see the point of this new fork "We are launching Ycash to restore a goal‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämining on commodity hardware‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat appears to have been largely abandoned on the Zcash blockchain.

We are also launching Ycash to uphold a promise‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat the Zcash Founders Reward would be forever capped at 2.1 million coins‚Ää‚Äî‚Äät"
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 4:43 AM
We have no involvement with Ycash
FWIW, my personal opinion is that the term "friendly fork" isn't helpful. When there's an intentional chain fork, people in both communities are likely to have a wide range of opinions about the other (indifference is also an opinion). I think the term can lead to people having the impression of endorsement from ECC or the Zcash community that isn't present in general.
Obviously Zooko disagrees with me on this. We disagreed at the time the "friendly fork" blog post was written, and I haven't changed my position: even if there's no animosity between the communities, I believe chain forks cause significant economic harm; they split mining effort; and for a private cryptocurrency they split the anonymity set.
Look at it this way: "friendly fork" is always a misnomer because "friendliness" is not a property of the fork.
And the relationship between two blockchain communities is always more complicated than can be summed up in one word.
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 5:04 AM
Another critical issue is that we should be highly skeptical that any new PoW-based coin will attract sufficient mining power to be adequately secure against rollback attacks. [Edit: I limit this to PoW-based coins just for simplicity and because Ycash is PoW-based; PoS and hybrid coins have their own bootstrapping issues.]

I didn't see anything in the Ycash roadmap to suggest that they were using cross-certification of blocks from another chain (as Komodo does for example), so I predict that it won't be secure against rollback at launch.

Hello @daira Many thanks for your replies, just reading now. Indeed the term "Friendly Fork" makes it sound a lot like it has the "blessing" of Zcash.
+100 with everything you say, i absolutely fully agree. From someone who has been "in" Crypto since late 2013, i have to say, the whole Ycash thing looks "iffy" (to put it mildly). Many thanks for this confirmation.

tromer Zcash Foundation 1:56 PM
SolarDesigner is doing superb work with the ProgPoW review (latest update: https://lists.zfnd.org/pipermail/general/2019/000073.html).
So far, it seems to validate the view that ProgPoW is promising but can be substantially improved and needs more analysis.

    üëç 1 

So we'll need to make a conscious about whether we're trying pushing the state of the art to get a solid PoW for the medium/long term, or trying to crystallize a good-but-suboptimal variant that can be deployed as soon as feasible.
To stress: I'm not opening the religious discussion of _whether_ ASIC resistance is desirable. I'm asking, if we _assume_ that ASIC-resistance is desirable, what's the right point on the spectrum between whatever-seems-to-work and the-best-we-can-do.
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:07 PM
I would err on the side of doing the best we could do in the time allowed, simply because it's only a matter of time before the PoW will have to be changed again. If going down the road of ASIC resistance is the desire, then having a good way to fork safely and often will be better than having the "perfect" algorithm to discourage ASIC development.

@z-888, I wrote the Ycash announcement. I borrowed the "Friendly Fork" terminology from the aforementioned ECC blog post. I in no way meant to imply that it had the blessing of the ECC or the ZCash Foundation. I'll try to add language to the announcement to make this explicit.

Every Zcash (and Bitcoin) full node has a keypool of 100 transparent addresses it generates when you start it. My guess is that the GUI is just showing you a random one you control.

I would suggest encryption for your entire HDD. Zcash doesn't support wallet encryption because Zcash also uses encryption, so it can cause bugs or errors in the core code.

Encrypting your HDD is a good idea anyway, so if your PC gets stolen they won't be able to retrieve your personal information.

if everyone on the team becomes powerfully rich, then the team becomes a powerfully rich team, you dig? and the rich never survive alone, unless they disappear into like a monastery but then they're not "rich" there. so, the team that stays together, stays rich. that's incentive. but, certainly some of the team will want to blow some steam off and total some $250k cars, that's only natural, and that'll get boring eventually üòõ
so, am I asking an obvious question or is this the wrong channel? is the plan to replace the c++ node/client with rust or alternative language set in stone?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 4:37 PM
Nothing is set in stone. That said, personally I expect that in the same way Sapling was primarily written in Rust and then attached to the C++ zcashd codebase, most of the larger new pieces of logic (that can be modularised) will be written in Rust.
Note also that the Zcash Foundation has contracted Parity to port their Rust implementation of a Bitcoin node to Zcash, so there will eventually be a pure-Rust implementation available alongside the C++/Rust hybrid that is zcashd.
krunch3r 5:33 PM
@str4d cool, thanks for helping me see the details on the situation, current state and how the future state might look like given the factors upon which the current objectives are predicated! I'm guessing there's a strategic plan somewhere online, but I more appreciate getting a verbal summary from an ECC team member relevant to my current question! it makes zcash a living currency, if you dig what I'm saying üôÇ

    @zooko @orgone33 @ask_aristarchus Fwiw I think a friendly fork is a horrible idea and that funding rewards should remain but taper lower with each halving.

I found out that exists an open-source solution called iquidus (https://github.com/iquidus/explorer), written in node.js and based on mongodb, which should work for any blockchain based coin.
The installation and configuration process proceeded without big problems, but the syncing of the explorer is very slow, i still am around block 17000 after about two days of running (and the total block height is like 530k+, so...).
Does anybody know if this is normal? Is iquidus a decent solution or are there better alternatives?

And it was mined 2 blocks after the 500 block interval specified for sending these transactions

if no, can we extract the sign transaction part from source code then wrap it to a library?
any guys could shine some light on this issue. really appreciate.

@dimitris.apostolou thanks for the quick response. This repo calls rpc, it needs to trust a full node in the first place. What I'm looking for is a pure library to sign a z-addr transcation. If there is no such lib, I'm thinking about if we could extract this sign tx part from source code. no idea if anyone has tried this before or not.

Ycash team members are free to disclose their involvement themselves in any way that they see fit, but I respect their desire to keep a low profile and focus on the work at hand. The original Bitcoin team kept a low profile and things seem to work out pretty well for Bitcoin.
This is a permission-less fork. So no one (including the ECC or the Zcash Foundation) has to agree to anything for us to proceed. And this is an fork, not an airdrop.

Don't worry, it's not (as long as you downloaded it from https://z.cash/download or you compiled it yourself from source). It's just that the antivirus software definitions don't include it in the "safe" apps. You could actually contact them and ask to include it. In any case, If you haven't done it already, whitelist it.

Is there a list somewhere of all individuals/entities who currently receive (or at some point received) portions of the Founders' Reward?
I've been reading up on thoughts and proposals surrounding its future, but am finding it difficult to determine conflicts of interest among discussion participants
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:44 PM
@sarang I don't believe there is public a list of everyone who has a portion of the Founders Reward. I would say the authors of the Zerocoin code, and the key ECC developers like Daira and Str4d are a safe bet. And there was some sort of vesting plan that ECC had in place for employees. Plus you have to count the VCs who initially funded ECC. It could be 50 or more people.
mineZcash Admin Owner 1:50 PM
And _technically_ you could say every employee/ contractor of the ECC and Zcash Foundation, along with all Grant recipients have benefitted from the Founders Reward because it's the ECCs and Foundations sole source of funding.
sarang 1:56 PM
I do hope that everyone receiving portions of the reward who also participate in the discussion will fully disclose this fact
Otherwise it makes much of the discussion feel a tad unethical
(also, thank you @mineZcash for this info)
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:02 PM
Keep in mind there is a difference between _direct beneficiary's of the FR_ and employees though. A direct beneficiary would have had a set amount of the 10% (2.1M coins). Employees who work for the company may or may not have any such benefit. I'm just speculating based on public information.
sarang 2:03 PM
Right. And it's well-known that the company receives FR directly, and uses it presumably to pay employees/contractors (making that disclosure relatively implicit)
The others seem pretty unknown
I was referring more directly to those
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:06 PM
The ECC hasn't released a full list of every direct recipient or the exact % that they get, that I know of. The exception being Zooko who has posted how much he receives publicly.
sarang 2:11 PM
Hmm, ok
Well, as I said, I hope that people disclose such conflicts in discussions, to ensure any decisions are made with this in mind
FWIW, I do not receive any Zcash FR üòõ
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:13 PM
Neither did I üòú but I do work as a contractor for the Zcash Foundation ü§ì
sarang 2:13 PM

mineZcash Admin Owner 2:16 PM
Someone has to keep this place going üòâ
sarang 2:16 PM
for sure
It would be an interesting change in transparency for the "new dev fund" option of reward extension to disclose individual recipients
(not saying that I support or oppose that particular option)
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:22 PM
I would think that any new fund for development wouldn't have any direct recipients like the FR had, but rather be paid out to ECC and Zcash Foundation and then converted to pay salaries, fund grants, etc..
sarang 2:22 PM
Right, but presumably such distribution would be much more open than it is now
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:23 PM
Indeed
sarang 2:23 PM
A big part of my difficulty in building a strong viewpoint on this issue is that I have basically no idea what was done with the existing FR
mineZcash Admin Owner 2:24 PM
If you dig back though the ECC blog posts you can find alot of information about initial funding and transparency

(except for the lack of detail in Diagram 2!)
but having that list of initial investors is great information
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:37 PM
Based on publicly available information, I would say it's quite safe to assume the following investors (apart from the founding scientists, advisors, main cryptographic engineers and Zooko who are all listed on the website) have been recipients of the FR:

Dan Morehead (Pantera Capital)
Barry Silbert (Digital Currency Group)
Bo Shen and Feng Xiao (Fenbushi Capital)
Andrew Lee (London Trust Media)
Kamal Ravikant (Evolve VC)
Naval Ravikant (AngelList)

Alan Fairless (SpiderOak)

IMO it shouldn't be up to the community to figure out financial conflicts of interest
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:50 PM
Hence my proposal for a Monero CCS-like funding mechanism üôÇ
sarang 2:52 PM
Well, zfnd already has the infrastructure for this, and it looks pretty solid
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 2:53 PM
Yes, feel free to read and comment on the forum. Would love feedback from yourself and @sgp on this.
sarang 2:54 PM
I've hesitated to comment so far because I don't understand the nuances of the Zcash community and its relationship with ECC and Zfnd as well as I'd like
It's certainly tricky since presumably ECC would like more ongoing and guaranteed funding for its operation
the Monero CCS is used primarily for one-off things (projects, outreach, travel) and for some ongoing funding (I request ongoing funding every 3 months for research)
sgp 2:57 PM
I also want to see more disclosures of possible conflicts of interest. The Zcash Foundation, for instance, should disclose their fund dispersement in these discussions as they are trying to evaluate community sentiment. There is clearly a conflict of interest that needs to be addressed somehow

    üëç 1 

sarang 2:57 PM
FWIW: some entities like the company and foundation are pretty clearly identified as recipients
sgp 2:57 PM
True
sarang 2:58 PM
it's people like certain employees and founders whose funding is not obvious
so it's really hard to know whose opinions may be affected by direct interaction with FR
sgp 2:59 PM
But I think it's important to keep repeating as the Foundation tries to summarize community sentiment on whether it should receive future funds. There's an incentive to say "of course the community supports us getting more money"
I think the Foundation is largely a good entity fwiw
sarang 3:00 PM
I do agree that it would be really nice to somehow identify participants' disclosures while the discussion is taking place, for maximal transparency (such disclosure should be voluntary, of course)
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 3:00 PM
Personally, I'm all for radical transparency.

    üëç 1 

sarang 3:02 PM
Agreed. The entire discussion/debate/whatever is too important and nuanced not to have everyone on the same page
I do have another question that's perhaps been answered elsewhere (but I haven't found it)... has ECC stated what level of funding would actually be required for them to continue developing Zcash?
Or what it would take for some combination of ECC/Zfnd/grants to do this?
I've seen the $200-300M "total FR using monthly averages" floated around, but it seems wildly unlikely that this is actually the answer
(and if it is, something is very wrong with the dev model!)

Right, but would that be projected to continue for the future?
Would they have options for Funding Level X and Funding Level X-1 and so on?
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:15 PM
And in that report you can see the re-balaced funds allocated to ECC and Foundation. They mentioned in the Livestream Q&A the numbers were a good basis for future funding
sarang 3:15 PM
As a thought experiment, with unlimited funding they could hire as many people as they wanted to meet all sorts of goals, and with $1 they would presumably shut down. What happens in the middle?
ah ok
IIRC they said they're currently running at a deficit
(read the report a while ago, don't remember)
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:16 PM
They were, until they re-balaced the distribution, last page of the report
sarang 3:16 PM
It would be good to know what they would have in mind if they did not receive the full desired funding level
Otherwise the community doesn't know what the results of different decisions would really be
I saw some options, like "let miners choose among several recipients" that could mean less-than-full funding that may fluctuate over time

The thing is they didn't specify any "desired" funding level, or what they would do with less. I think they are specifically avoiding the question to not influence the conversation.
sarang 3:20 PM
At face value, that's a bit worrisome
Would the community avoid a lower funding level simply because of a fear of the company shutting down?
I get the idea of not wanting to influence, but leaving people in the dark would be its own kind of influence
At a super simplified level, you can't budget when you don't know what things cost
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:23 PM
"Pivot" was a option discussed in that video, but what that would be is anyone's guess. Zooko said they are "All in ZEC" so no other avenues are currently being pursued.
sarang 3:25 PM
Right, but those don't really address what the actual costs are
Obviously nobody wants to go out and effectively fire people, but it's disingenuous not to go in with full information about what the effects of a spectrum of funding would be

    > Obviously Zooko disagrees with me on this. We disagreed at the time the "friendly fork" blog post was written, and I haven't changed my position: even if there's no animosity between the communities, I believe chain forks cause significant economic harm; they split mining effort; and for a private cryptocurrency they split the anonymity set.

    > FWIW, my personal opinion is that the term "friendly fork" isn't helpful. When there's an intentional chain fork, people in both communities are likely to have a wide range of opinions about the other (indifference is also an opinion). I think the term can lead to people having the impression of endorsement from ECC or the Zcash community [or more generally, the community that is being forked from] that isn't present in general.

I'm still on the fence about a the notion of a friendly fork. At the end of the day it's not something that could be prevented since it's open-source software anyway. But I would say I think it's it's better overall to regard non-contentious forks (ie: friendly) as "better" than the alternative fork (highly contentious) where Developers are openly attacking each other.
My opinion is more like Meh, fork ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

@mineZcash to play devil's advocate, why is one better than the other for users?
mineZcash Admin Owner 7:16 PM
I would have to land on the side of preferring positive interaction: like "hey, have fun making that fork, good luck!" rather than the toxic nature of the adversarial fork which I think would cause more of a rift in the userbase/community.
BostonZcash 8:31 PM
Having been deep in the trenches of the Bitcoin blocksize war, I can say that any split not fueled by vitriol is a sigh of relief. While I don't welcome a fork, one possible upside is there'll be a pressure valve for those who feel slighted by Zcash not pursuing ASIC-resistance. About half the griefing I see is from those quite stirred by that issue. It'd split the mining effort, but isn't their intent to switch to a new algorithm?

sarang June 26, 2019 2:23 PM
A big part of my difficulty in building a strong viewpoint on this issue is that I have basically no idea what was done with the existing FR
@sarang Per the transparency report, ECC has been getting about 4% of the block reward in recent months (Q2 2019) for funding development. Extrapolating (lossily) by assuming it was approximately the same throughout the project's history, that means we've had a budget of 8750 ZEC/month for development. It's been about 32 months since the birth of the blockchain, so that multiplies out to about 280,000 ZEC so far.
sarang June 26, 2019 3:04 PM
I've seen the $200-300M "total FR using monthly averages" floated around, but it seems wildly unlikely that this is actually the answer
Another data point is that (again from the transparency report), we've spent about $700k/mo in Q2 2019. Again with the simplistic lossy extrapolation, if we'd done the same all along, that would mean we've spent $22m since the beginning of the blockchain.
zooko Electric Coin Company 4:21 AM
The mismatch between these numbers and the wild "$200‚Äì300m number" that floats around is due to the 12.8% "Founders and Vested Employees" number from the Transparency Report. That is a lot of money! But it is not money that ECC spent, or had access to, for development.
zooko Electric Coin Company 4:57 AM
@sarang We've been going to quite a lot of effort to communicate how much things cost (which is different from making a request or proposal). Please read the transparency report and watch my Zcon1 talk. (But also watch Nathan's Zcon1 talk, which is a more important and bigger-picture perspective that doesn't focus on the Electric Coin Company.)
sarang June 26, 2019 3:22 PM

@sarang Did you mean to use "disingenuous" here? "Disingenuous" means not candid or sincere -- pretending not to know something that you know. Did you mean to imply that someone is doing that? I kind of suspect that word is a word that is overused in other communities and that you didn't really mean to accuse anyone here.

zooko Electric Coin Company 5:12 AM
Yes, I continue to think that Friendly Forks are extremely beneficial for strategic, cultural, economic, legal, and technical reasons, but I'm not going to try to persuade Daira about this. The friendlier and more collegial the community is, the greater the benefit. There is a natural human tendency to regard neighbor tribes with hostility because they are competing for your scarce resources, but this is anachronistic. In the modern day, neighbor tribes are not consumers of resources ‚Äî they are producers of resources. However, that human tendency to tribalism is strong, and it will be interesting to see whether the Zcash community gives into that tendency or continues to value openness and benevolence more.
zooko Electric Coin Company 5:29 AM
Ycash in particular looks really good so far. Howard Loo is a long-serving member of the Zcash community. He got a grant from Zfnd and ‚Äî unlike a lot of grant recipients ‚Äî he delivered what he was paid for (beautiful advertisement posters). His beliefs ‚Äî while I have often disagreed with them ‚Äî have always been based on principle, well-reasoned, and expressed in a respectful and constructive manner. His stated rationale for creating Ycash is consistent with those principles. The Ycash Dev Fund is well-designed: 5% of the block reward perpetual, going to a US non-profit for the purpose of development. That's sustainable, incentive-aligned, and proportionate. And simple! It's an excellent design because it is simple and incentive-aligned. The technical work that the Ycash project has done so far is mostly focused on protecting Ycash and Zcash from harm due to the fork. That's an encouraging signal of both their technical competence and their priorities. Everything that I've seen them say to the public has been completely devoid of price-pumping hype/fomo stuff. This is quite exceptional in this industry and again it speaks well of their character and it is consistent with everything else I've observed about them. Overall I'm very impressed so far and I'm extremely grateful that the first Zcash Friendly Fork is as high quality as Ycash seems to be.

@zooko I did finally get a chance to sit down and watch your talk (disclaimer: haven't had time to watch Nathan's yet)
"Disingenuous" probably wasn't the optimal word since it implies intent, but I stand by my overall concern that, from what I've been reading on the how-to-fund discussion, I don't feel like I have sufficient information on a practical cost/funding spectrum to have a well-formed opinion on the situation
I understand that your decision was to bring your company "all in on ZEC" in terms of dev resources (and it sounds like actually hiring more talent), but the report and talk and forum threads that I've seen don't seem to directly address what ECC could or couldn't do if the current funding level (as suggested by the report) were not continued
e.g. if, as you mentioned in the talk, some future dev fund were split between ECC and other entities
You mentioned "slow down" as a rejected option that would place ECC's role into maintenance mode, but surely there's a range of company responses and ability between "all in at current cost level" and "maintenance mode to avoid running dry" that might affect how the community sees the role of future consensus-enforced funding
sarang 8:15 AM
Maybe a better way to express my current lack-of-formed-opinion is that it's not really clear to me what the mapping is between ECC funding and its ability to maintain the asset and set goals for development. Is it fairly continuous (if ECC receives X% of current funding, it can do Y but not Z) or is it more discrete (if ECC receives < X% of current funding, it stops everything but maintenance)
sarang 8:39 AM
It occurred to me that the same question is also equally important to know about the Foundation, should its funding change (ping @sonya @cin etc.)

sarang 9:08 AM
More spitballing for the sake of discussion... what if the dev fund option (either controlled entirely by Zfnd or split between Zfnd/ECC/others) came with a strict requirement for enumeration of expenditures by those entities? One of the mods here brought up the Monero CCS / Zfnd Grants model, where projects are expected to have fairly detailed accounting about the costs involved. Even when used to fund people instead of projects, it means the community is kept radically in the loop about where the money goes
(financial disclaimer that I receive funding through the Monero CCS)
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:24 AM
@sarang Yeah, I see the question. I don't think there's a succinct answer, though. We don't have contingency plans for what to do with less and less money, and per the "All In On ZEC" strategy, we're not going to work on making such contingency plans for now, but instead focus on executing our most ambitious plans for growth and success. However, we could get an empirical data point from recent history: during the Crypto Winter (before the "dilution" event which increased the percentage of FR that went to dev costs), we were under financial strain. We didn't have to lay anyone off, but we did refrain from hiring (including hiring replacements for people who left) and refrain from starting new projects. The effect was that we went slower (and everyone on board got more and more stressed out). I'm not sure what lesson from that is, though.

sarang 9:26 AM
I can't speak for anyone else in this community of course, but IMO having contingency plans clearly stated is critically important to make an informed decision on this... otherwise there might be the looming unknown question of whether "all in" means "all or nothing" in the event of a change in the funding model going forward
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:27 AM
Hm.
sarang 9:28 AM
I've enjoyed seeing the robust debate on the ideology of what a dev fund should mean, and where it should go, and how trust and control should be distributed; but at some point the community has to start talking concrete numbers, and there needs to be good data about what these numbers would mean

    ‚úÖ 1 

(my apologies if Nathan's talk addresses any of these questions, since I have not yet watched it)
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:31 AM
Well, we've given our best shot at disclosing concrete numbers with the transparency report. That's the most reliable information available because it is empirical rather than speculative. Another good source of information would be to look at other dev teams and what results they've produced at what costs. Perhaps your experience with Monero could help here. The Zcash dev funding question shouldn't be too ECC-specific. Fortunately for Zcash, ECC doesn't have a monopoly on being able to provide such services. ECC doesn't even necessarily have to be involved in the solution.
Here's the transparency report for anyone who hasn't seen it: https://electriccoin.co/blog/electric-coin-company-q2-2019-transparency-report/

    electriccoin.co
    Electric Coin Company Q2 2019 Transparency Report - Electric Coin Company
    The Electric Coin Company is committed to openness and transparency ‚Äî as we help evolve and support the Zcash digital ‚Ä¶

sarang 9:35 AM
Sure, but I assume that ECC wants to be a part of this going forward, so maybe a good informal standard is that any entity that might want to be a part of consensus-based funding should put forward something of a request or proposal for what services they could provide at what cost. Otherwise, the community ends up shooting in the dark based on where the target was over the past few years. The burden shouldn't be on the community to determine how much funding different teams need to meet their goals; it should be on those teams. This levels the playing field and keeps everyone in the know
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:36 AM
Right, so that's basically what the transparency report does, by showing what we're currently doing and what it currently costs.
sarang 9:37 AM
Should the community take that to represent what ECC would do if it received its ongoing share of the FR going forward?
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:37 AM
We're intending to put out such transparency reports regularly, going forward, which will also help give insight into how such things change over time.
sarang 9:37 AM
I do stand by my assertion that I think questions of "what would/could you commit to doing with less?" are entirely reasonable here
Since it leaves open the option of separation of funding between entities.
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:38 AM
ü§î Well, yeah. ECC would definitely want to continue doing all of those things if we could.
sarang 9:38 AM
Right, and I'm sure the community would like those things to continue being done. But it might decide that it prefers to spread out development goals among entities for decentralization, or some such thing
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:39 AM
Good point.
sarang 9:39 AM
But if it doesn't know what that would look like, it's shooting in the dark
I think this all boils down to my view that a more thorough breakdown of what _any_ team would do with certain funding levels (whether it's ECC, or Zfnd, or some other hypothetical team) provides the kind of radical transparency that seems to jive with the cryptoasset ethos, and promotes a level playing field
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:42 AM
Hm. So, like, the Zcash community could issue an RFP saying "Hey dev teams: what will you do for us for 1%, 5%, 10%, or 20% of the block rewards"?
sarang 9:42 AM
Ooh, viewing this as an RFP is intriguing
and of course, this could be broken down even further, from "% of block reward" to "some fixed number of ZEC"
Some projects are more short-lived anyway
Maybe a team really wants to implement a ZIP that ECC doesn't commit to, for example
or build some tool
the fixed-number-of-zec thing might mean that a steward like Zfnd receives X% and uses it to continue or expand the grants platform
and the ongoing % idea jives well with ongoing dev funding (like how ECC is funded now, hiring people to work full- or part-time)
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:45 AM
Yeah.
sarang 9:45 AM
Monero FFS/CCS struggled for a bit deciding how to handle ongoing funding, since it wasn't really built for that
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:45 AM
What did you come up with?
sarang 9:46 AM
We break up ongoing funding into 3-month "projects" that need to be requested for each such period
it's a bit of a kludge that lacks built-in stability (funders could decide to stop funding at any time)
The advantage is that if we stop performing up to standards, the funding can go away, which seems reasonable
The downside is that the funding lacks the stability of more traditional full-time work
But: if you were to use some percentage to fund project-based work (like what CCS/grants are built to do) and some other percentage to fund ongoing work (with the stipulation that you need some kind of accountability over time), maybe you get to bridge the gap
This, of course, assumes there is a magic 8-ball that tells you what "the community" wants (IMO nobody has really figured this part out)
future213 9:50 AM

sarang 9:52 AM
I was intrigued by the "miners decide" funding option, since you could tailor it to ensure that some level of total funding is always present, but give more immediate feedback on whether or not the funding is being used in a way that's valuable to at least some portion of the community (this, of course, gives miners a _huge_ advantage in determining where asset development goes...)
It could be interesting to tinker with how this could be done with transaction fees, perhaps
I know of a grocery store that pledges a certain amount of its profits to charities, but lets customers decide between several. You get a little wooden token with each transaction, and you can put it into one of several boxes representing different regional charities... this determines the distribution they pay
So maybe replace "transaction fees" above with "some kind of flag in each transaction"
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:56 AM
Yeah! Really neat idea!
I don't like the idea of giving miners a lot of power. What if the community would be well-served by research into hybrid PoW/PoS? Or GPU mining?

    üëç 1 

sarang 9:58 AM
Yeah, the miner idea does essentially single out one portion of the community for decision-making
but FWIW it's crazy hard to assess actual community views IMO
zooko Electric Coin Company 9:59 AM
In fact, research and development into basically *anything* that increases security and protects users in any way other than hashpower could be seen as reducing the need for the community to spend so much money on miners.
sarang 9:59 AM
true
The shift to transactions changes this power imbalance and moves it to the users, but I'm sure this could be gamed somehow with transaction flooding, etc.
zooko Electric Coin Company 10:00 AM
Hm. ü§î It sort of boils down to stake-based voting, except you have to burn your stake (in TX fees) to vote.
And people who were spending TX fees anyway get a vote for free.
Oh, and we would need TX fees to be at least partially burnt or spread out over future miners (as in the New Fee Market proposal) or else miners could pay back voters.
sarang 10:03 AM
Fortunately I view the question of how to gauge community sentiment to be mostly separate from how to best ensure that RFP teams make thorough and transparent requests
I think one is clearly easier than the other üôÇ
zooko Electric Coin Company 10:04 AM
I like the fact that Aristarchus's proposal mandates the development of a governance and funding system in four years. That's about the right length of time to work out the issues in this stuff and we're also going to learn a lot from other projects over the next few years.
sarang 10:05 AM
If there were a push for some kind of RFP (and assuming the meta-problem of determining how the community votes on all this) for ongoing development (or specific grant-style projects), do you think it's reasonable for ECC to be able to participate in it at that level?
In the sense that the company has basically lined up what it thinks its commitments to big ZIP-style goals can be
(and other teams could put forth RFPs for development to handle other ZIPs that ECC isn't up for)
all this assumes the looming timeline of NU4 and ECC's stated runway
I like the RFP idea because if ECC is awarded its proposal funding for whatever goals it puts forth (seems very likely, given its development record), employees get stability and the community knows that ECC was held to the same request standards as other teams were

zooko Electric Coin Company 10:14 AM
@sarang Sure, we'd definitely consider applying for something like that! Continuing to serve in the role of Zcash core devs is obviously our dream! I hope the Zcash community decides to hire someone for that role and that we get a chance to compete for it.

sarang 10:14 AM
What if the idea were tweaked a bit to award the full 20% to Zfnd, with the stipulation that they are the stewards of the RFP process via some kind of community funding board?
It's tricky because I assume that Zfnd would want a share of that via their own RFP...
zooko Electric Coin Company 10:15 AM

sarang 10:15 AM

zooko Electric Coin Company 10:16 AM
And my "Sure" was a response to your "could ECC participate in an RFP process".
sarang 10:17 AM
At the end of the day, there's probably going to be one or two big entities pulling the trigger on this, and I suspect having the nonprofit Zfnd be the arbiters (even if they are participating in the funding) would sit better than having ECC do it since they are for-profit and not subject to the same disclosure and legal requirements as Zfnd
zooko Electric Coin Company 10:17 AM
@sarang Yeah! That's a great idea.

sarang 10:25 AM
@cin @sonya have you any thoughts about what a Zfnd-managed RFP process might look like for determining levels and distribution of ongoing consensus-based funding? Even if there is no direct community vote (which seems logistically improbable) on which RFPs to fund, interested parties in the community could work with Zfnd to set proposal standards to ensure that all potential funding recipients provide the desired level of detail about what they want to do and how much they need to do it
As stated in my lengthy conversation above with @zooko, presumably Zfnd could submit its own RFP to do things like pay its employees or offer project-specific grants
sarang 10:36 AM
Or maybe the RFP requirements and proposals are such that none are accepted, and all consensus funding goes away. I think it's important that this be a possibility (however unlikely it might be in practice), since the argument that the social contract assumed funding goes away in X years has merit
cin Admin Zcash Foundation 11:09 AM
@sarang Hi @sarang! Great discussion and questions above. If I'm understanding your view of the RFP process, you're envisioning something broader than our current grant platform (e.g. it would encompass meta-funding our grant program, and any other activities we'd want to engage in/protocol dev/ECC funding/other team funding etc). My personal opinion (and I want to stress that this is my own and not officially from the Foundation) is that the coordination costs are too high to do that effectively, relatively to other suggested proposals...then funding protocol development itself for Zcash will face the same challenges as DAOs, except with a slight advantage that the Foundation might be the one creating policy around organization (and having the benefit of non-profit transparency and governance).

In terms of gauging community sentiment and evaluating possible proposals, expect a more detailed perspective from the Foundation soon! TBH, we are still recovering from Zcon1. üòÖ
sarang 11:22 AM
I suppose the goals that I was considering when looking at the RFP-style model were (1) ensure a uniform standard of accountability from all recipients of consensus-enforced rewards (CER); (2) ensure there's a uniform selection process for CERs to ensure that some entities don't have a built-in advantage beyond their own records and history; (3) encourage more detailed and thoughtful breakdowns of CER, so it's clear what different funding level decisions would mean for larger entities like ECC and Zfnd (i.e. what exactly would you do with less/more funding? what goals? what are you buying?); (4) promote the idea that any chosen funding (keeping in mind that "there will be no CER" is always an option) should be long-lived enough to ensure the stability needed for a given project or development goal or organization, but short-lived enough to assure real feedback (i.e. it must be possible for the funding to go away if the entities don't provide value)

    üëç 1 

It's a huge ask
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:11 PM
Any kind of "dev fund" is essentially a mandatory tax on the community.

Any kind of community funding should be opt-in. If the community feels they approve a specific proposal, they could decide to fund it.

If they feel the proposal is not worth it or they disagree with it in principle, then they don't fund it.

My basic premise is: let's decentralize funding and let the community decide.
covfefe 3:03 PM
And in this scenario, how does the community decide? Who decides who the community is?
Great discussion above, I'm usually a lurker here, but love how generous everyone involved in this project is with their time

    ‚ù§ 1 

sarang 4:07 PM
@dimitris.apostolou I would be astounded if the community could regularly raise the kind of funds that would cover the costs of something like ECC+Zfnd or an equivalent
I personally prefer the opt-in nature of donation-based funding as providing choice to users, FWIW
But it has huge downsides for funding ongoing work
If you operate on the assumption that opt-in funding won't cut it for what the community wants out of development, seems like an RFP-style approach is most practical
If you operate on the assumption that (a) the community can be relied on for a lot of stable donations; and (b) that recipients are willing to accept the inherent risk; then opt-in is a good idea
but ECC says they spend about 700K USD per month

As this network update considered hardfork, any Exchanges that are not updated to the latest v3.2.0 daemon on their backend will be out-of-chain and will no longer in our supported mainchain. Thus, for our safety and to avoid inconvenience, it is prudent to remove all your ZEL prior to this and keep it at your own updated ZelCore v3.2.0 - Panda or ZelMate v7.4.0 or Web wallet at https://my.zel.cash

hi all. @mineZcash I am interested in building a secure-storage-element backed Zcash wallet on the lines of the reference wallet announced here: https://electriccoin.co/blog/the-zcash-reference-wallet-is-here/ Is there a place where I can find the requirement specifications for a Zcash wallet? I suppose looking at the zips are one option but I was wondering if there is single document that compiles the requirement spec for the wallet. Thanks for your help!

@mineZcash Thanks for your response. üôÇ I was however looking for some specifications that back the implementations. After posting this question I found the ZIP 032 doc here https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/zip-0032.rst#bip-0032 This is closer to what I am looking for. I am looking for the requirement specs of the wallet components so that I can go through them and decide which of them can be implemented on hardware and which of them in software. For instance,the signing, hashing, key storage etc can be in a secure element with its own crypto processor and the rest of it can be implemented in software.

@mineZcash is right, you should ask in the Ycash discord. In general though, exchanges each have their own criteria for listing which are usually pretty strict
they won't list a coin just because it is a chain fork of another coin that they list

Halvings are important moments in any cryptomoney‚Äôs maturation as they double the marginal cost of producing each incremental unit (at constant hash rate), moving the asset further along the scarcity curve.

It's a question of governance, the nature of decision making, the intent of the original emission schedule, ensuring a fair playing field, and allowing the community to make an informed decision.

sarang 5:44 PM
@zooko what would help with _part_ of this (certainly not all) is a better understanding of what funding levels ECC _actually needs_ to do different things with ZEC
If ECC is going to take a position in this discussion (and, let's be frank, they absolutely are), it should be on the company to be forthright about this, not on the community to ascertain it from past reports and development

@sarang Hi @sarang. Perhaps I can help clarify some things.

Some elements (R&D, the outcome of R&D) are difficult to quantify explicitly up front other than funds for salaries needed to employ world class cryptographers and engineers. Our intent is to build L1 scaleability and interop in driving toward global adoption of Zcash as a long term medium of exchange as Nathan articulated at Zcon1. We'll publish a summary blog soon (target Thu). That requires world class talent, and that talent needs a runway to ensure they can meet personal financial obligations without the stress of applying for short term funds. These are fundamental, large-scale improvements and the future of Zcash hinges on these improvements.

Another priority is driving the adoption of shielded transactions. This requires a mix of business development, pr/marketing and regulatory work. Prior to June we were short funding. We were running a deficit and that forced to pause certain investments on this front including our plans for Asia, campaign development and PR. As part of our decision to go 'All In', we are now restarting these efforts and hiring additional talent. This also allows Jack to focus on regulatory efforts full-time as his time was fragmented prior to July. I'm happy to dig into further specifics as best I can.

@JoshS: I get that it's tough to quantify the complex issues you brought up, but a key part of this discussion is that any devfee _must_ be quantified
It's not possible to bake anything else into the protocol
I had stated elsewhere that if there must be a fee (and I no longer think there must be), it should be doled out to groups (like ECC or others) based on specific requests/bids, and this would assume specific required amounts
sarang 7:55 AM
It does not appear that this is going to happen, and based on the organization of Zcash governance and community, it doesn't appear there is any other organizational structure that would be chosen for this purpose

Hi zec team! Where i could find zcashd v2.0.5 patched for explorer? It seems that zcashd v2.0.4 hit EOL and there aren't any updates in zcash-hackworks/zcash-patched-for-explorer repo üòû
brad Electric Coin Company 10:30 AM
@larryruane ‚òù
larryruane Electric Coin Company 10:43 AM
@alex.r, I have good news and bad news. The bad news is that there isn't a v2.0.5 version, and there won't be (at least, that's the current plan). We're merging all the Insight Explorer changes into zcash master, see https://github.com/zcash/zcash/issues/3708. This is part of the good news. The reason I didn't create a v2.0.5 is because I tried to do this, by simply rebasing the hackworks repo from zcash master (which in the past was always easy), but this time there were zillions of merge conflicts. This is because we had already merged in part of the changes into master (before v2.0.5 was cut). So zcash master is in this kind of halfway state.
But the other good news is that EOL logic isn't enabled on testnet. Are you wanting to use this for testnet? If mainnet, then there is a temporary problem. Because of your question, I'll bump up the urgency is getting the rest of the changes merged into zcash master. It's actually all done, if you would like to help test it, I would really appreciate it! https://github.com/LarryRuane/zcash/tree/3708-getblockhashesrpc That code may change slightly as a result of reviews that are in progress.

alex.r 11:00 AM
@larryruane Oh, thank you so much for such a detailed answer.
I need to run it on the mainnet cause we have our own zcash insight mainnet explorer
I am glad to help with any tests. If I understood you correctly, I need to compile the branch 3708-getblockhashesrpc
and start it with insight-api (bitcore-node)?
larryruane Electric Coin Company 11:12 AM
@alex.r Yes, you should be able to clone that repo, compile, and it should work with bitcore-node. It's untested, but is up to date with v2.0.6. You would be doing me a big favor in testing this!

But also very important: The way the explorer features are enabled is slightly different, because we wanted to make it easier, so please refer to this: https://gitlab.com/zcash-docs/zcash-docs/blob/insightexplorer/source/rtd_pages/insight_explorer.rst (that's not commited yet to our official docs). You will also need to reindex (that's explained in that documentation). If you have any suggestions for the documentation, I'd love to hear those too.

@alex.r I just did a reindex not long ago, and I should have more carefully kept track of the time, but I think it was over one day.

I agree 100% that if ECC has a particular position, it needs to share it and make it known. I believe that it should do so with care, understanding that it has an extremely privileged position in this discussion and a much broader audience than the average bear
It would be most welcome if this position were given in the context of ECC's role in any final decision-making process; after all, both ECC and ZF have an _enormous_ financial conflict of interest, since they both are involved in formal decisions made about Zcash and are potential recipients of funding from any such decision

sarang 6:58 AM
It would be interesting to see a Quesnelle-style study of these more recent shielded transactions to see how many are still trivial links: https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.01210

    arxiv.org
    On the linkability of Zcash transactions
    Zcash is a fork of Bitcoin with optional anonymity features. While transparent transactions are fully linkable, shielded transactions use zero-knowledge proofs to obscure the parties and amounts of the transactions. First, we observe various metrics regarding the usage of shielded addresses. Moreover, we show that most coins sent to shielded addresses are later sent back to transparent addresses. We then search for round-trip transactions, where the same, or nearly the same number of coins are sent from a transparent address, to a shielded address, and back again to a transparent address. We argue that such behavior exhibits high linkability, especially when they occur nearby temporally. Using this heuristic our analysis matched 31.5% of all coins sent to shielded addresses.

Because that is a wall we'll have to jump eventually, each Zcash should be, could be $10,000 at one point; in one year to be more specific.
Just have to jump through 2-3 main things:
*Resolve funding problem without team disassembling like etc dev.
*Higher Scalability
*Partnered/accepted at major merchants

Zcash is the real digital gold. Taking in consideration many consider Bitcoin is digital gold, most of Bitcoin's codebase was ported over to Zcash
Zcash is a clone of Bitcoin but with much much better innovative and cryptographic improvements, making Zcash superior by default fundamentally/cryptographically/technologically. Zcash bringing economic opportunity to the masses.
Zcash is #1 Private Digital Cash #2 A store of wealth/Net Worth #3 Digital Gold
carlos.lopez 11:13 PM
My only one point for bettering Zcash in both a Marketing angle and spreading adoption/ease of use and major use case in general for Zcash'es and Imo something DEFINITIVE that should be done with much more reason is if the Team decides to go "all in", (but even if they don't this should get done for a better Zcash and uses): A luxurious mobile wallet gold and black like the Zcash logo supporting both shielded and transparent addresses, awesome and smooth interface. @zooko

    arxiv.org
    Map-Z: Exposing the Zcash Network in Times of Transition
    Zcash is a privacy-preserving cryptocurrency that provides anonymous monetary transactions. While Zcash's anonymity is part of a rigorous scientific discussion, information on the underlying peer-to-peer network are missing. In this paper, we provide the first long-term measurement study of the Zcash network to capture key metrics such as the network size and node distribution as well as deeper insights on the centralization of the network. Furthermore, we present an inference method based on a timing analysis of block arrivals that we use to determine interconnections of nodes. We evaluate and verify our method through simulations and real-world experiments, yielding a precision of 50 % with a recall of 82 % in the real-world scenario. By adjusting the parameters, the topology inference model is adaptable to the conditions found in other cryptocurrencies and therefore also contributes to the broader discussion of topology hiding in general.

So with the ZIP deadline in August of this year, does that mean that any protocol-enforced funding decisions (e.g. non-miner fee allocation) must be formalized by that date?

no
that's only the deadline for submission of draft ZIPs

Hmm, so presumably it learns no metadata of value except for IP and transactions that it relays out for the client?
and presumably timing information, since the lightwallet would ask only for block data that it hasn't previously seen
(this is an interesting piece of metadata)

linda Electric Coin Company 3:51 PM
@sarang, the trust model between the lightwalletd server and the client is such that the server cannot cause a loss of funds from a wallet.
You're correct in assuming that the server should only learn the IP address (which can be mitigated with use of Tor or equivalent service), number of transactions, and the timing of the transactions.
We've discussed the potential risks of a server being rogue, and some of those include: 1) denying the wallet service by not sending it blocks as they arrive 2) delaying the arrival of some blocks to try and fingerprint users --i.e. mark one particular wallet as 27 blocks behind.
sarang 3:53 PM
Wait, timing of specific transactions destined for the client's wallet?
linda Electric Coin Company 3:53 PM
No, only that a client has sent a transaction at a specific time.
sarang 3:53 PM
What about for incoming destined txs?
linda Electric Coin Company 3:53 PM
All blocks are sent to the client and the client determines if there were any transactions for the client.
sarang 3:54 PM
Righto, so it can do some fingerprinting based on block height, then
Would be interesting to have the client fudge that somewhat
linda Electric Coin Company 3:54 PM
We strip the blocks of data that a light client doesn't need (i.e. information needed to verify blocks) and do some fancy tricks (i.e. not forward any blocks without a sapling input or output).
It could, but this can easily be mitigated by the client not trusting any one server persistently.
We don't see this as big of an issue at this point. Most wallets trust their servers, and lot of third party wallets seem to fully trust their own server.
sarang 3:55 PM
Otherwise, the use of something like Tor masks the IP but could allow linking of identity across sessions with the same server/client
Oh sure, third party wallets can trust their own servers
I'm thinking of the common use case where a user has a wallet and can choose any server
and where that server should not be assumed to be trusted
Then the metadata analysis gets fun üôÇ
linda Electric Coin Company 3:57 PM
I see. I'm not picking up your question or concern, could you clarify?
sarang 3:57 PM
It was simply an observation about the metadata and information that a rogue server could keep, in order to fingerprint clients
For example, keeping track of block heights requested
linda Electric Coin Company 3:59 PM
Yep, you are absolutely right. We performed an internal audit and found the issue a couple of months ago: https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet-sdk/issues/34

sarang 4:00 PM
Keeping a robust trust model seems like a good idea, to encourage the use of light wallets that don't come equipped with a fixed server (which is a single point of failure) and the use of public nodes
linda Electric Coin Company 4:00 PM
I do encourage you to discuss the issue there specifically if you've got a good idea.
sarang 4:00 PM
I had been thinking about the idea of having clients lie about their known height
so they request extra blocks according to some distribution
linda Electric Coin Company 4:00 PM
We absolutely agree with you there, no single point of failure.
sarang 4:00 PM
(and then ignore those that they lie about)
Anyway, thanks for the information about the lightwallet work... I hadn't been following it closely and it's neat to see it being applied
linda Electric Coin Company 4:01 PM
Interesting! I suppose it will take a bit of fleshing out to determine if the threat is worth mitigating, and to randomize/limit how many extra blocks to request. üôÇ
I'll add your idea to the github ticket above, so we don't forget. Thanks for that.

sarang 4:04 PM
Cool, thanks. It's fascinating to see the similarities and differences between the trust and threat models for Zcash and Monero (since I do research focusing on Monero)
esp. since Monero lightwallets need to request decoy information from their nodes (and these can be falsified)
linda Electric Coin Company 4:06 PM
@sarang , what is the Monero threat model?
sarang 4:10 PM
Pretty similar to that of Zcash (client-server interaction to receive blocks, etc.) but with the addition that the client requests decoy information that cannot be locally verified
So we add some tricks to mitigate that (to an extent)
(the client requests its own output as part of this list, and ensures that it is valid... it turns the risk of a rogue server into a statistical game)
linda Electric Coin Company 4:39 PM
How interesting! Thanks for that information.
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 5:28 PM
We detailed a very similar strategy in ZIP 307 - download blocks in batches.
sarang July 29, 2019 4:00 PM
I had been thinking about the idea of having clients lie about their known height
We haven't implemented it yet, because as above the initial threat model was such that the server was assumend to provide a correct view of the chain. But it's definitely something we've thought about.

@str4d for the use case where public nodes are advertised to different light clients, IMO it's a very good idea to assume the server can/will lie about its view of the chain
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:24 PM
Of course
sarang 12:24 PM
or at least that it will keep track of the blocks it provides to different clients
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:25 PM
But that wasn't the initial use case.
sarang 12:25 PM
What was?
In the Monero ecosystem it's become very common
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:25 PM
Wallet providers that ran their own infrastructure
sarang 12:25 PM
Ah, I see
We see an interesting mix between wallet providers that offer a server, and those that don't and allow the user to choose their own (or provide a list of common ones)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:29 PM
Yep. The trust relationship(between user and backend) for larger wallets that run their own infra is already established, so adding additional data capabilities to the backend is a simple extension. For wallets that rely on public goodwill infrastructure, there are weaker trust relationships, so the inband assurances need to be higher.
sarang 12:29 PM
Right. I think that it's important to account for that, to encourage public nodes and less trust in wallet providers over time
Helps to avoid the case where a provider has a rogue or otherwise flawed server setup (or perhaps is being monitored by an adversary, etc.)
e.g. an open source wallet probably doesn't want to run its own server ($$)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:32 PM
Yep (relying instead on public goodwill infra)
sarang 12:32 PM
exactly
the Monerujo wallet is a great example of this
It has a list of popular public node pools (with random selection within those) and allows the user to specify their own
(they don't run a node of their own afaik)
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 12:34 PM
And that in turn is derived from the Electrum model

daira Admin Electric Coin Company 12:00 AM
Translation: "Since my English level is not very good, I still use Chinese to communicate. I think everyone has a way to translate it. Because the total number of ZEC is only 21 million, the future is more used as a large transaction and value reserve. My current point of view is: 1. No additional issuance, and the total number of 21 million must be kept unchanged. 2. The team can continue to receive issuance, but must consider other members of the community, such as the feelings of miners, I think this ratio should be less than 10%. 3. ECC should think more ways to promote the value of ZEC.

The best way is to pay 10% directly to the zcash foundation. The foundation is responsible for the allocation and use of funds. The speed of ECC work must be accelerated. Internet companies also need to provide efficient work results while providing perfect benefits. Not a pension industry, not a pension company.

If the team continues to receive a high percentage of issuance, it will damage the miners, and the interests of the holders will cause many people to leave. This is what ECC must balance."
I'd like to respond to this with my personal opinion, not speaking for ECC
First, no change to overall issuance was ever proposed, and that is not on the table
Second, the Foundation has made it perfectly clear that they're not prepared to be solely responsible for distribution of a dev fund
Third (and this is more clearly just my own opinion). I think miners are only there to do specific tasks in the protocol: assembling transactions into blocks and making sure that the blocks are in a total order. That's all.
Miners are collectively rewarded *extremely* well for these simple tasks
Due to the difficulty adjustment, it isn't the case that mining profits have a simple linear relationship to the proportion of issuance going to mining reward. As a thought experiment, consider if half of the mining reward instead went to charity. What would happen is that there would be fewer miners, lower difficulty, and less overall wastage of energy on PoW
But the protocol would still work perfectly well, and each remaining miner's profit margin would be roughly the same, if we ignore sunk costs in mining hardware
Of course we can't ignore sunk costs, so it's a bit more complicated than that in practice
But the basic point remains: mining is *only in the protocol at all* in order to achieve the goals of assembling transactions into blocks and putting those blocks in a total order. It would be a bad idea, in my personal view, to give participants in this part of the protocol (which is largely independent of other protocol layers) excessive power over future protocol direction or governance of the token.

It's a widespread misunderstanding that the FR (or a possible future Dev Fund) results in higher sell pressure on the coin compared to sending 100% of the coins to miners.

hello every Zcash enthusiasts! I have a few questions about Zcash initial investor. I've read the F&Q, which says the proportion of initial investors would be distributed to them ( 1.65% in total).
And my question is
1. How often do the investors receive the Zcash? is it on daily/weekly/monthly basis? or all the investors receive the Zcash as soon as the miner mine it?
2. do the initial investors have lock period?
3. If there's lock period how long is the lock period. If there isn't can they sell beam as soon as they receive the beam?
thanks to all the Zcash enthusiasts in advance

does Zcoin still reveals payment destinations and amountsÔºü
mineZcash Admin Owner 3:58 AM
That is the old *Zerocoin* protocol, it is not relevant to *Zcash* . You can find the Zcash protocol here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zcash/zips/master/protocol/protocol.pdf
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 6:42 AM
the question was about Zcoin, though. I don't know the answer off-hand
I know that Zcoin had several serious balance violation bugs (largely due to using unreviewed academic protocol code that was never suitable to be put into production), and I believe they entirely disabled their privacy functionality as a result. More recently, they've moved to a different protocol. I haven't had time to study the privacy properties of that new protocol

A fully shielded, 1-input 1-output transaction is 1488 bytes
And the capacity is 2000000 bytes per 150s. After Blossom, that will be 2000000 bytes per 75s
connie.ji 3:45 AM
Thanks~ Daira~
daira Admin Electric Coin Company 3:45 AM
So it's ~9 tps, doubling after Blossom
The work we're doing on scaling, if it pans out, will *greatly* increase that
About zk-STARKs: maybe never, because there are other proof systems that look more promising

all of the currently available proof systems without trusted setup have significant drawbacks. zk-STARKs have very large proofs; infeasible to put in individual transactions. There's some question as to whether Spartan actually works (it was not implemented/benchmarked as part of the paper). Bulletproofs has O(n) proof size and verification time. Hyrax requires uniform circuits, which results in very difficult programming and optimization. (zk-STARKs also have a difficult circuit programming model.)
connie.ji 9:22 PM

sonya Admin Zcash Foundation 12:07 AM
@connie.ji I can't speak for Daira directly, but my sense of things is that since Powers of Tau (https://www.zfnd.org/blog/conclusion-of-powers-of-tau/) would have been *so* hard to corrupt, it doesn't make sense to prioritize a replacement unless it's clearly better on multiple axes
I'm optimistic about non-trusted-setup options improving over the next few years, but I lack the expertise to know whether that optimism is justified

Hello there, I am currently trying out Zcash, does anybody know a working faucet site for testnet coins? https://faucet.testnet.z.cash/ seems to be down.

That faucet hasn't been upgraded for Blossom. I posted a while back that I wanted to shut it down when Blossom activates as was supposed to be a stop-gap fix for the official one see https://chat.zcashcommunity.com/channel/dev-infrastructure?msg=JvCuozp5dHQhBjAbq but obviously Blossom activated before anything was done. I'll take a quick look shortly but in the interim @levant I have sent you some TAZ to that address above https://chain.so/tx/ZECTEST/4087de4c209e4a4152b01cec8f1cce7c782ee0913807027e545210b686a88847

I also want to stop my hosted faucet when Blossom activates rather than upgrade as it was supposed to be a quick stop-gap until these cert issues were fixed on https://faucet.testnet.z.cash/ but it's been 6 months now. Happy to assist in resolving these issues where I can.

Major hit for EU customers.
On my question why, I got reply: These are the requirements from banks. It is pretty much like: do you want to keep the dollar transactions or you want to keep anonymous coins. That's the jist of it.
We want to preserve our capability to process fiat.

Unfortunately, we are not in the position to influence banks on that (because guess what - they have regulators who tell them what to do).

As much as we understand the community desire and love for those coins, we also want to continue doing what has been the core of our business: maintaining fiat to crypto transactions.

Hi, I am new here. We have been using ZCash testnet in our project for a while now, our tests (regarding submitting t-address transactions) started failing since we updated to use the latest v2.0.7 zec node. Are there any changes to how transactions are built in the new update? I tried to find resources on changes to txs but was unsuccessful to find any. It would be of great help, if someone could point me to any resource that would help explain this. Thanks.
* For more context, we build txs using our library (not the ZCash node).

Is it possible to set the `expiryheight` to be unlimited when generating a zcash transaction?

It says here that this is possible by setting the expiration to be 0, but I couldn‚Äôt find how to configure this:

https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/zip-0203.rst#specification

I tried to call the createrawtransaction rpc method by passing 0 as below:

`raw_tx = self.rpc.createrawtransaction(in_txn, outputs, 0, 0)`

But it looks like the minimum for the `expiryheight` in the `createrawtransaction` is 4.

Hmm, that seems like an RPC bug that crept in when we added the logic to prevent users from setting an expiry height that is too soon (3 or less).

It should remain possible to disable transaction expiry (though I don't personally recommend doing so).
Could you open an issue?
mohamedgr 6:13 PM
Sure, I can open an issue. How about setting the `expiryheight` to the maximum value of `499999999`? Would that be a good alternative to disabling transaction expiry?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 6:24 PM
For now I guess it would, but it would be very identifiable

dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:00 AM
You can ask here.
blim 6:23 AM
Hi. Thank you. Well here goes. I bought a very small amount of zcash on coinbase and downloaded a wallet (zecmate). I transferred the zcash to the wallet's address before the wallet had finished syncing it's blockchain and have spent the last 3 days waiting for that process to occur (still only at 52%). All i was trying to do was use that small amount to purchase a subscription on another site. Do I have to wait until the wallet is 100% synced before I can do this?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:24 AM
Yes
blim 6:26 AM
is it perfectly reasonable that it might take 7 days on a relatively current Mac with a reasonably fast connection to do this?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:26 AM
Or you can import the seed or private key on a mobile wallet and use it instantly (I assume it's a t-address).
blim 6:27 AM
yes it is
how do i do this without the transaction itself being synced to the wallet?
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 6:32 AM
Just import the seed or private key on your mobile wallet.

Is there a reliable API that gives you the UTXOs for a specific ZEC t_address?
tromer Zcash Foundation 8:12 AM
`zcash-cli listunspent "taddr"`
mohamedgr 8:15 AM
Thanks @tromer, I meant a blockexplorer API not the RPC. I need this because I will be running an offline ZEC node, so it will not be possible for me to get the UTXOs using the RPC method that you suggested
mohamedgr 9:52 AM
Is there a way to enable the Sapling and Overwinter upgrades to an offline node without having to sync to above the activation heights of these upgrades?
str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 10:08 AM
Which APIs are you using? The offline-ish APIs (in particular signrawtransaction) support taking the consensus branch ID for the target network upgrade as a parameter.
mohamedgr 10:17 AM
I see, is the `signrawtransaction` that supports the consensus branch ID? These are the RPC methods that I am using: `sendrawtransaction`, `getnewaddress`, `validateaddress`, `dumpprivkey`, `createmultisig`, `createrawtransaction`, `signmessage`, `verifymessage`, `signrawtransaction`
mohamedgr 12:12 PM
Also it seems like the is not just about signing, according to the documentation, the transaction format must follow the new transaction format from Sapling onwards

https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/nu_dev_guide.html#sapling

How can I make sure that the `createrawtransaction` will create a transaction that follows the new v4 format with an offline node without having to sync the node above the activation height of Sapling?

I tried reindex and re-downloading of blockchain data and then i also ended up upgrading the node to the latest 2.0.7-2 and downloading entire blockchain again. I'm still getting same issue. getrawtransaction is showing me that tx but gettransaction says error : non-wallet tx id

He knows what it means to be underestimated. South Bronx has a history of being low-income and high-crime. Carlos sees something else - opportunity, creativity, hustle. He understands how digital currencies, in the right hands, can make good on the promise of financial inclusion, right to privacy and security. Electric Coin Company, alongside other projects in the space; Gemini, Flexa, Messari and Casa and others, joined forces to help his students learn how digital currencies help their specific community. We would like to invite others in the space to join and help set up similar projects in other communities around the world.

    @terry.carte this is a pool issue, not a Zcash network issue, so you will need to contact the pool operator to see what is going on.
    Or you can try switching to a different pool, Slushpool and Flypool are both reliable.

    I personally feel absolutely private and safe in the Sapling z-address pool. I never dealt much with t-addresses before (and don't plan to utilize any in the future). t-addresses should die ASAP.

    sgp 5:07 PM
    Can someone please explain the privacy features of wrapped ZEC on ETH like Josh talked about? In both the context of ZEC and wZEC
    sgp 5:14 PM
    Eg: will I be able to tokenize shielded ZEC, and what infornation would be public on the wZEC?
    ayatoslaw 8:17 PM
    is there anyone who can give an explanation, why should i choose zec?
    I heard ZEC did hardfork which gave birth to ZCL, and ZCL is now falling.
    daira Admin Electric Coin Company 11:15 PM
    Zclassic is/was a code fork of Zcash, not a block chain fork
    In any case, the Zcash devs aren't responsible for any forks. Our focus is on the Zcash protocol and ZEC. We don't have any influence over what fork developers do or what consensus rules they use, not can we provide any support for forks. Fork developers do whatever they want to do.
    It therefore isn't really accurate to think of forking as something that the ZEC block chain has done.
    IMHO, most forks aren't able to sustain a usefully large developer community, anonymity set, or mining power for adequate security. Some forks have been able to partially mitigate these problems (e.g. PirateCoin has a decent anonymity set, and Komodo addresses the mining power problem by use of notarisation), but I'm still very skeptical about the sustainability of Zcash forks in general

    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:38 PM
    If you are referring to a file storing the blockchain, no. You need to sync the whole blockchain if you need to run a full node.

    would be useful for who want to run a fullnode

    if I have a wallet.dat from 2017, how could I port it to that zecwallet-light-cli? Is there an easy way to obtain the seed phrase?
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 10:01 PM
    Unfortunately, importing private keys to the lite wallet is not yet supported and a seed phrase is required. If you need to use the light wallet, you would need to just send the funds to it and carry on using it then. But if you are utilizing z-addresses (which you should), it means you would first need to sync the blockchain, then send the funds, and after that you could delete the blockchain and just use the lite wallet.
    str4d Admin Electric Coin Company 11:16 PM
    Also, zcashd stores a 32-byte seed internally, while ZecWallet uses the BIP 39 format where a seed phrase is turned into a 64-byte seed.
    (the discrepancy is a bit annoying, but we did not have time to do BIP 39 while implementing Sapling)
    byron 12:17 PM
    Thanks for the replies. I loaded the wallet.dat into the full-node zecwallet to get the private key, then copy pasted that string into guarda. Are there any downsides to using zecwallet-light as a cold storage? If that endpoint "lightwalletd" goes down, I can take that bip39 seed phrase and regenerate the keys in a different wallet, right?

    It sounds like the IRS allows some leeway here in the exact construction of the worldwide index. Their typical mindset is "reasonable and consistent method" for following the given guidance. But they've been explicit about "exact date and *time*".

    @zorg hi welcome to the chat
    The ZFND and ECC have not publicly disclosed when or where they sell ZEC that I know of.

    That old investor list were paid out in the first year, the only advisors that are currently involved with the ECC are listed on the ECC website: https://electriccoin.co/team/

        ‚òë 1 
    mineZcash Admin Owner 1:00 PM
    And to your last question, I believe ECC and ZFND are not seeking private investments because they could be asked to do things that may not be good for Zcash. For example if a VC group wanted to pump the value of Zcash for short term gain they could pressure them to change the code somehow. The block reward system (in my opinion) along with two parties (ECC and ZFND) is the best way to ensure engineers, developers, scientists can get compensated for working on Zcash without pressure from 3rd parties, while being held accountable to the Zcash community.

    ‚ÄúI think one downside of the Zcash approach is that by associating the brand of the [Electric Coin Company] and the open-source technology so closely together, you occupy the brand association and space around the protocol. It doesn‚Äôt create an opportunity for other companies to feel like they could own this thing.‚Äù

    I assume you are referring to GPU miners? From my speaking to them, it's more about the fact they value the security of the network more than what particular hardware mines it.
    I would posit that most current "demand" for cryptocurrency is speculative at this point üòâ
    You do realize that Starkware was started by Prof. Eli Ben Sasson, one of the founding scientists of Zcash. Who I would guess got most of the funding to start Starkware from his portion of the founders reward.
    zorg November 11, 2019 12:46 PM
    @mineZcash true, but the stock to flow will still be an issue and demand is speculative at this point. I wonder how much ZEC ecc has to sell a day? Also, Its kinda sad to see projects like coda and starkware with over $50 mil in funding and zcash with so much less.

        > Claim one: It is a security feature for a particular coin‚Äôs mining operations to be the dominant application of the hardware used to mine that coin.

        > Claim two: Manufacturing and ownership diversity will be improved with ASIC-friendly algorithms.

        blog.coinbase.com
        How Coinbase views proof of work security
        Coinbase recently changed the confirmation requirement of four different assets, including reducing Bitcoin the confirmation requirement‚Ä¶

    The first point was made by @zooko and others.
    The second one is new to me, and rings true: if ASICs are going to happen anyway, then might as well make the algorithm simple to implement in ASICs in order to reduce barriers to entry and increase manufacturer diversity.

    I think the customer perspective and merchant perspective are very different. I agree that for most merchants, using a payment processor is easiest!
    So it would be useful to have a dedicated webpage listing the known payment processors and their constraints (e.g., brick&mortar vs. online), as well as links to what to do if they want to do it for "real" and keep a ZEC wallet.

    Random motivation: right now I want to send a donation to a listener-supported Internet radio station. They accept only credit cards and PayPal. I want to tell them, "I'm going to send you $... but do you mind getting it as ZEC? Here's an easy guide: <link>".

    It's the merchant's business whether they're OK with broadcasting their revenue. It's _my_ business whether I'm broadcasting my (in this case) music preferences. As as long as I can _send_ from a z-address, I'm happy as a customer.

    Hey! What is the fastest way to get up and running with shielded tx on macos? Are there any trusted sources for downloading a pruned full node with blocks included?
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 8:40 AM
    The fastest way is to use https://www.zecwallet.co

        www.zecwallet.co
        Zecwallet Lite
        Zecwallet Lite is a fully featured shielded wallet for Zcash. Syncs in under a minute. No blockchain download needed!

    dolebas 8:41 AM
    Many thanks @dimitris.apostolou will head over and try it out!

    @dimitris.apostolou hey, "...the server can learn what blocks contain your shielded transactions" does the same apply in the full Node version?
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:29 AM
    No, on the full node there is no server. You run the node yourself.
    UndZeCash 1:29 AM
    also, can you elaborate more on: "learns other metadata about you like your ip address etc...", as in etc like what, do you have a complete list?
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:30 AM
    If you need absolute privacy, run a full node.

    1 more thing, i ran the lite version just then with torsocks, worked fine, doesnt seem to bypass the proxy
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:31 AM
    I don't know the internals of Zecwallet Lite very well. @adityapk00 can provide further info.
    UndZeCash 1:32 AM
    yes, i get that full node is the better option, i just find that if people know more detils about the live version the adoption vs monero would be faster, because monero is a pain in the ass on tor
    all good, thank you for the quick reply üôÇ
    *lite version
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:33 AM
    The Monero CLI runs fine on Tor with torsocks.
    I run it myself üôÇ
    UndZeCash 1:35 AM
    yes, also need full node for monero, im just saying that, the lite version for zcash is more appealing than monero, in the sense of the fees and shields, (as in not as much to set up as monero)
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:36 AM
    Well, Monero also has very good mobile wallets. Hopefully, Zcash is getting those in the near future.
    UndZeCash 1:36 AM
    im running torsocks zecwallet-lite now, just checking it out, see what happends.
    oh, btw,
    i asked this question in devs: what do you think, how come people dont want full nodes on phones? i think it would be a good idea nodes wise
    imagine if everyone had full nodes on the phone, there is enough space for it, power as well
    as in computing power, battery may become an issue
    oh and, limk phones into mobile mining pools just for good measure üôÇ
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:42 AM
    My personal feeling is that it's not practical.

    First, you need Android. I personally only use Apple products so I could never have a full node on my iPhone because Apple will never allow it :D

    Second, the bandwitdth requirements are massive. You would need an unlimited data plan to make it worthwile.

    Third, and most important, why on earth would I want to run a full node on my phone? It's an overkill. If you have Android, you can run a full node on your computer and pair your phone with it so you get all the privacy and benefits without having to sync the blockchain on the phone.

    These are of course my personal views. Others may find it useful to run the whole node on their phones. I would never do it üòõ
    UndZeCash 1:46 AM
    good points, my train of thought mainly, its for privacy, i use apple as well, so yea, i agree with that too. The way i look at it is that, everyone is in control of their node, its mobile so the node expansion is gonna be massive üôÇ
    the unlimited bandwidth could be an issue, but with 5g coming out, it might be not as much
    i can see more telcos moving closer to wifi calls, so i dont know if its going to be that much of a stretch to see data plans grow as well
    dimitris.apostolou Moderator 1:48 AM
    For people in the US it's not a big deal I guess. I used to have unlimited data plan for $40/month a few years ago when I lived there.
    UndZeCash 1:49 AM

    Hey, anyone here who can help me with a weird issue I've have with ZecWallet Lite?
    I was just testing out the new lite wallet by 'converting' a very small fraction of my ZEC balance from my transparent address to my shielded address (I wasn't sure if this worked or not), but then I noticed that the block explorer listing for my transparent address said that my entire balance was gone, so I got quite worried. I then shut down and reopened the lite wallet, and my balance was there, but now it was ALL shielded.

    I'm just wondering how this could have happened?

    I luckily still have my entire balance, but now I'm quite worried that I'll try send a small amount of ZEC to someone and they'll end up with my entire balance.

    And my transactions tab still lists the 0.0002 transaction I made from my t to my z address, so I didn't slip up when inputting how much to send.

    Is it not possible (at least on ZecWallet Lite) to have only a portion of your balance shielded? Is that why the the wallet saw I was trying to send ZEC from my t to my own z address and decided to send/convert the entire amount instead?

    I'm not super familiar with Zcash, so apologies if my questions/comments reveal how uninformed I am.

    tromer Zcash Foundation 7:24 PM
    I think that Zecwallet Lite automatically shields anything received to your t-addresses, by automatically resending it to your z-address. (I wonder which one! Maybe the first?)
    So I'm not sure how you even ended up with a balance in a t-address managed by Zecwallet Lite...
    @adityapk00 ?
    BTW the way that Zecwallet Lite shows transactions sent to self is confusing and inconsistent. In particular, how they're displayed and their effect on the balance changes when the transaction is mined.
    tromer Zcash Foundation 7:31 PM
    ^ @linda @str4d, do we have some guidance on how balances should be conveyed to users, that precisely says how to handle unconfirmed transactions and transfers-to-self?
    Or any guidance on how to perform and convey the automatic shielding?
    How much of that is/can/should be encapsulated into the SDK/libraries provided by ECC?
    arrancar 7:34 PM
    hmm well if you say the lite wallet may automatically shield transactions to transparent addresses, then maybe that's what happened?

    It's just confusing because this 'conversion' only happened after I tried sending that fraction of ZEC from my t address to my z address, plus it was only when I reopened the wallet that it appeared to be shielded

I had to withdraw ZEC from my Kucoin account first, and they only let me withdraw to a transparent address, so maybe the wallet just didnt refresh to show that it had then converted that from my transparent to my shielded amount
tromer Zcash Foundation 7:35 PM
@arrancar, yeah, I'm also seeing some t balances lingering unconverted. Not sure what's going on, or what's _supposed_ to happen. @adityapk00 , I think this needs attention.
arrancar 7:36 PM
cool. Please tag me if you find out what's going on. I'm glad to have a lite wallet but just want to know how it works in situations like this haha

    üëç 1 

and thanks for giving me some insight
adityapk00 7:38 PM
@arrancar @tromer Zecwallet lite will automatically shield all your transparent balance, when you send the first outgoing tx. That is, when sending any transaction, it checks if you have any transparent balance, and if you do, it will use the same tax to shield it.

    üëç 1 

Perhaps this can be clearer in the UX.
*made clearer
arrancar 7:44 PM
ohhh okay that makes sense
thanks for explaining that. I do agree that it would be good if this was clarified somewhere on the wallet. It's obviously really useful, but when it's unclear _how_ it happened, it can be confusing
So transparent transactions technically aren't possible from the Lite wallet then? Since the wallet will automatically convert it into a shielded transaction?
adityapk00 7:58 PM
No, you can make transparent transactions too. If you send to a transparent address, it will send the transaction using balance from your shielded address.
arrancar 8:01 PM
But that's only transparent on the recipient's end, right? It would still be shielded on my end, and thus the transaction couldn't be traced to my address, yes?
simon-0 8:06 PM

adityapk00 8:09 PM
@arrancar correct. Zecwallet lite will always prefer to send a shielded transaction.

Oh, it will do so opportunistically at the first transaction that you happen to send?
The privacy implications are weird.
If (a) Alice sends some ZEC to Bob's Zecwallet Lite t-address, and later (b) Bob pays some ZEC to a t-address, then the two transactions are linked.
But if Bob happens to have made some unrelated payment (c) to some z-address inbetween (a) and (b), then (a) and (b) are no longer linkable? @adityapk00

Hello @jammyjam likely not soon, the infrastructure of wallets and exchanges need to support Z-addresses before a change like that could be pushed.
jammyjam 3:37 PM
pirate chain used only z to z addresses by default. Why is this difficult for zcash if a coin like pirate chain can do it
What do you think of pirate chain using the z to z function by default?
mineZcash Admin Owner 4:06 PM
How many exchanges/wallets/vendors support Pirate chain? Plus what would happen to all the transparent funds users currently hold? It's not as simple as one might think.

If you need to send ZEC urgently, just use another wallet. Plenty of options out there.

Hello, I need a little help with Zcash in a pool setup. Since Dec 28 2019 we get this error in debug.log

"ERROR: ContextualCheckBlock: founders reward missing"
We are running zcash v2.1.0-1
There were no changes to the pool software and everything was running smoothly up to Dec 28 2019. Can you please let me know if something has changed in the reward distribution?

@george-2 Dimitris is absolutely correct, if you send funds to an address you do not control then there's no way for you to get the funds back unless the person who controls that address is willing to return the funds.

Hi
I don't know if this is the right channel to ask this question, so please redirect me if I'm in the wrong place.
Right now I'm trying to better understand the zcash protocol and I was wondering why it wasn't allowed to spend unconfirmed incoming funds from splitjoin transactions.
If I understand the 3rd section of 8.1 in the protocol specification correctly, there shouldn't be any issue right? There it is stated that it is possible to chain transactions because they happen atomically.
dimitris.apostolou Moderator 7:21 AM
